# Deadlock
- Deadlock is the kind of game that you would not improve at all if you do not get any guidance anywhere. Seriously.
- Anyway, the few turning points that change my idea of the game that would help a lot are the following.
    - It is okay to die.. for a reason.
        - Getting objectives (Walkers, Rejuv, helping a higher value teammate stay alive)
        - Don't be afraid to jump into the frontline, it's surprisingly difficult to die. Also you won't even learn how to fight on the frontline if you don't jump in...
        - Also it's surprisingly reasonable to help turn a 1v3 into a 2v3.
    - Efficiency
        - Laning: 
            - You can gain a soul advantage by securing your creeps + soul, but you can't gain an advantage by only denying enemy creeps. Last hit those creeps!
            - There are level 1 jungle creeps nearby, usually you kill these if your lane is pushed up waaaay too far (whereas you become unable to secure / deny reliably without pressure). The jungle creeps help counteract this if you want them back.
                - They also make great filler for your time if the enemy is dead and you have nothing to do in the meantime (ie stealing the enemey's creep)
        - Jungling: The default strategy should be push up your lane as far and as safe as possible, usually up to the mid line. Anything beyond that should require you to look at the map if the enemy is distracted.
            - If all lanes are pushed up, feel free to bide your time and kill some jungle creeps... near your teammates if you have the resource to help them.
    - Go get a community build, the default ones are quite questionable.
        - There's a "Browse Builds" button on the top right. 
        - Once you get used to a community build, copy and edit into your own one. Again, very important to show that you understand what your hero needs.
    - Laning:
        - Some heroes are better when letting creeps push into their tower (Mirage, one poke deals large amount of damage over time if enemy stays in the open)
        - Some heroes are better when pushing creeps in (characters with grenades in their kit, enemies are forced to huddle down into tight corners)
        - If your laning partner is pushing in, go in with them! Seriously, it's better to potentially get a 2 KO instead of your laning partner dying alone.. and then you next.
    - Go understand what your hero does:
        - I actually played Infernus first because well, let's be honesty his design is sick. My first mistake was trying to spend 100% uptime running right on top of the enemy to "maximize" damage. But it doesn't. Your opponents get ignited the full time the moment you touch them. The actual correct choice to maximize dps is to Run at them and start shooting so you get both trail and on-hit procs.
        - Anyway, a lot of these can be solved by watching how others play. The main problem is that you might not even notice it if you aren't aware of it in the first place, again another reason why I say you REALLY need someone to help watch you play and watch your inefficiencies. It's really similar to why people recommend teachers when learning music. You don't know what you don't know.
    - The Map and Hero UI:
        - ***Seriously, pay attention to the map at all times.*** Good macro play can even outplay cheaters that lack game sense.
        - The Soul amount at the top will indicate who has an advantage. If you have a soul disadvantage, your main options are to either group up or split push.
        - The map will indicate where everyone is, if no enemies are visible, you probably don't want to push beyond the middle line unless you have some sort of fast, safe, disengage, like Viscous' Goo ball ult.
    - The usual game plan:
        - If you are low on souls, try to do a split push to get an objective. Also it will help a lot if you can successfull gank (and kill ) a high soul target. 
            - Technically speaking, if in a team fight, both team has one person die, you "gain" more value since your opponent had more money.
        - If you are high on souls, don't die. Each death will set your team back and it snowballs back very quickly. Also try and assist your teammates in team fights, avoid overfarming.
