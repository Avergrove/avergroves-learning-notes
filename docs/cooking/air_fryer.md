# Air Fryer
Rather than provide recipes, I'm going to write in rules of thumb.

- Air fryers are incredibly efficient ovens. So if you are using oven recipes, try reducing cooking time to 2/3, and temperature to 5/6.
- The top of the cooking food will often get burned, use an aluminum foil to spread out the heat.
- Thick meat takes a while to cook, try using lower temperature and longer time so the heat has time to spread in before the chicken burns.
- The air fryer generally blows in air from the top, so if you stack your food up high, it's likely the food high up will get burnt. Also the center of the food will also likely to be burnt. Try putting food on the side to prevent hot air from blowing on your food directly if you want to use a high temperature.


## Spray oil
The main reason to pick different spray oil is burning point.

These smoke points are taken from wikipedia.

Although your temperature might be set to lower than that as listed, the way air fryer constantly blows air in the same direction can cause some part to be overheated more than usual!
Height will also affect the heat distribution.

This is why we usually want to set the temperature lower than the expected one.
