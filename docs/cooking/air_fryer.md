# Air Fryer
Rather than provide recipes, I'm going to write in rules of thumb.

- Air fryers are incredibly efficient ovens. So if you are using oven recipes, try reducing cooking time to 2/3, and temperature to 5/6.
- The top of the cooking food will often get burned, use an aluminum foil to spread out the heat.
- Thick meat takes a while to cook, try using lower temperature and longer time so the heat has time to spread in before the chicken burns.
