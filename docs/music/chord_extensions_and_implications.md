# Chord Extensions and Implications
- omg SDPC Extension reference (joke)
- chord extensions are basically anything beyond 7+ notes in a chord, they're there to give a chord more flavor without altering the core sound.

## The safe chord extensions
- Major 7s: 
    - 9 is safe
    - #11 is safe
    - 6/13 is safe.
    - Conclusion: Stacking a major chord on the second of the major 7 is safe. (and sounds beautiful!)

- Minor 7s:
    - 9 is safe
    - 11 is safe
        - b11 converts the chord into major 7. So no.
    - 13 is safe.
    - Conclusion: Stacking a minor chord on the second of the minor 7 is safe.

- Dominant 7s:
    - Honestly, do whatever the hell you want it's already dissonant. I don't care.
    - There IS a chord called Hendrix chord, though: It's 7#9, so if we use that.
    - #9 is kul
    - 11 is whatever
    - 13 is whatever
    - Conclusion: Stacking a Dimsus2 chord (wtf) is kul

## 6th vs 13th
- A 6th chord is not the same as 13th because it's special.
- Although Add6 is technically the same as 13...because the 6th doesn't include the 7th. yeah honestly that's it.

## 9/11 th Chords
- You might be able to think of sus chords quickly, but you might stagger when thinking of 9/11ths!
- So, as a first exercise, let's map 9/11th to sus chords!
- Then you can memorize from there

## 13th chord scales
- A 13th chord implies every note in a scale is used! It's easier to remember it as a scale and adjust accordingly.
- Here are some "commonly" used ones. They are commonly used because they just.. make sense and harmonize with the scale.

| Chord Symbol  | Constructed scale | Note |
| ------------  | ------------- | ------- |
| C △13        | C Major scale  |
| C △13 #11    | C Lydian Scale | This is a major-y a major chord can get |
| C 13          | C Mixolydian   | This is a groovy and mixolydian chords get |
| C -13         |

- Another way to think of 13ths is think of 9th as manor chord starting on 2nd.

## What about playing it?
- Throw away the fifth. You almost never need it.
- If someone says play a 13th. It usually means play a 13th without the 9th and 11th
- If you want to add a 9th in, do it if you'd like, it's really just there for funsies. 9th is the safest extension and you can always add it in.
- The 11th is the neglected child... until its not.

## Chord Implications
- An extended chord or slash chord is another way to show how to play a chord quickly.
- The extension is ironically quite important, otherwise they wouldn't be writing it since you would just be adding it when you feel like it.

### Major 7ths
- Majors 7ths are usually played as-is
- CM7#11: This is the standard Lydian chord.

### Dominant 7ths
- Dominants are often used as the "default" chord if the 7th doesnt matter, but the extension 
- C7flat13 chord: Play an augmented C
