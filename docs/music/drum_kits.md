# Drum Kits
Percussion section instrument in the jazz trifecta (Melody, rhythm, percussion)

The percussion section is responsible for setting up a groove of a song and setting up the time for the entire team.


# For those that haven't played a drum yet..
- Go to a drum studio. One hour is surprisingly enough to learn the basics.
- The first drum studio I went to had sticks available! Make sure you ask the receptionist if they provide sticks.
- Go learn what each drum is called
    - Foot percussions:
        - Kick drum: The kick drum is sounded using the right foot pedal. It's the big bass one on the floor with the pedal that you step on.
        - Hi-Hat: A cymbal attached the snare attached to a left foot pedal. To remember it easily, just imagine the cymbal as a cute gremlin saying "hi" whenever you open it wiyth the foot pedal.

    - The middle 4
        - Snare: This is the "default" drum, it's the one in white on the bottom left and sounds kind of filled.
        - Toms
        - Floor tom: This is the biggest tom and is usually standing from the ground. It sounds hollow and deep, and it sits in front of you on the right
        - High tom / low tom: This are the two other toms on top left and top right. Sometimes only one of them is available.

    - The right side:
        - The ride cymbal: Appropriately easy to remember because it's.. on... the.. ride.... sorry i meant right.
            - Sometimes there's two of them.

    - The Left side:
        - The crash cymbal: The ride cymbal is on the right so the crash cymbal must be on the left.
- Then, go learn how to read drum sheet music, and play along to each of them! You don't have to be perfect.
- Then, search up the basic "rudiments".
    - Rudiments are kind of like scale practice for drums. They're simple and fundamental but rather important.
- Finally, go have fun! Turn up a song and play.

# Free Stroke
- Basically you should avoid death gripping the drumsticks.
- Instead of death gripping, you should try holding it such that when you hit the drum with it, it automatically rebounds into your hand without much force, like a basketball.
- Also, this force should be applied from your wrist, not your entire limb.
- Another way to think of how to hold the drumstick is kind of like doing the wobbly pencil trick. You can't do a wobbly pencil trick if you death grip it.
