# Clef Transposition
I play a Tenor saxophone, that means I'm using a transposing instrument! That also means the sheet music I play is "not in concert"

But what if I want to play directly from a concert sheet? If I play a C, I would get Bb... of course, I could just play a D to get C but... really are we going to transpose every single note one by one?

Enter clef transposition. Instead of trying to calculate each note one by one, we transpose the whole bloody clef into another.

Of course, the price to pay is that now you need to learn new clefs but... hey, we're always trying to learn new things right?

Anyway, going directly to an example, try playing a "regular" sheet music (aka concert pitch sheet music) using your tenor saxophone and playing it in alto clef (Alto clef is the one with the pretty symbol pointing towards the center / third line). Also then add 2 sharps to the key signature. (Because we need to compensate converting the 2 Bflats into no accidentals)

What? You're using an alto saxophone? Okay try playing a "regular" sheet music using your alto saxophone and playing it in soprano clef. Also, add 3 sharps to the key signature. You should now sound correct.

Eh? You say you can just transpose the sheet music in a software? Well, yes, but I don't pay for a subscription on musescore because im cheapo, also most classical sheet music is in scanned format so...

Also there's real books in a lot of jazz bars. Go learn clef transposition lad.

Either way, here's a quick table of what clef you would use for some common brass instruments:
|Instrument | Reading from..   | Read as            | Key signature Modification |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
|Bb         | Concert (Treble) | Alto               | +2 Sharps                  |
|Eb         | Concert          | Soprano            | +3 Sharps                  |
|Bb         | Eb               | Mezzo Soprano clef | -1 Flats                   |

You can also use it if you are playing on an Alto Recorder if you dont wan't to learn a "second set of fingering"

|Instrument       | Reading from.. | Read as            | Key signature Modification |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------| ---------------------------|
|Soprano Recorder | Concert        | Treble             | None!                      |
|Alto Recorder    | Concert        | Mezzo Soprano      | -1 Flat                    |

Clef transposition is actually related to the key signature value technique. I've written down what clef is needed for each modification type. I didn't update the table since it was in my journal and I am a lazy derg.

These are all assuming you are playing from a transposing instrument trying to read a concert pitch (good ol' treble clef) sheet

### Flat signature instruments
| Instrument key | Modification | Read as Clef |
| ---------------| -------------| ------------ |
| Gb             | + 6 Sharps   | Mezzo Soprano(Sharp) / Baritone (Flat) Clef (Play F# get C), Play F get B |
| Db             | + 5 Sharps   | Tenor Clef (Play B get C) |

| F              | + 1 Sharp    | Baritone Clef (Play G for C)|

### C Instruments
| Instrument key | Modification | Read as Clef |
| ---------------| -------------| ------------ |
| C              | nil          | Treble clef  | 

### Sharp signature instruments
| Instrument key | Modification | Read as Clef |
| ---------------| -------------| ------------ |
| G              | - 1 Flats    | Mezzo Soprano Clef - Play F get C
| D              | - 2 Flats    | Tenor Clef - Play Bb get C, Play A get B
| A              | - 3 Flats    | Play Eb get C, Play D get B
| E              | - 4 Flats    | Soprano Clef clef - Play Ab / G# get C, play G get B 
| B              | - 5 Flats    | Alto Clef - Play Db get C, play F get E
| F#             | - 6 Flats    | Mezzo Soprano / Baritone Clef - Play Gb get C, play F get B

### How did I memorize this?
- I use **"Baal Soba Time"** to remember flat instrument signature. Baal is like some god of destruction or something. Soba is a type of japanese noodle. Time is the thing musician must keep track off or else they get booed off the stage.
    - Ba: Baritone
    - Al: Alto
    - So: Soprano
    - Ba: Bass 
    - Ti: Tenor
    - Me: Mezzo Soprano
- Memorize alto clef is +2 sharp, so the order must be baritone = 1, alto = 2, soprano = 3 and so on.
- Notice that for sharp instruments, the same order can be used. 
- Notice that the absolute value of both numbers add to 7. So alto clef adds 2 sharp, so it must add 5 flat in the other direction. (2 + 5 = 7)
