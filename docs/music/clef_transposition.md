# Clef Transposition
I play a Tenor saxophone, that means I'm using a transposing instrument! That also means the sheet music I play is "not in concert"

But what if I want to play directly from a concert sheet? If I play a C, I would get Bb... of course, I could just play a D to get C but... really are we going to transpose every single note one by one?

Enter clef transposition. Instead of trying to calculate each note one by one, we transpose the whole bloody clef into another.

Of course, the price to pay is that now you need to learn new clefs but... hey, we're always trying to learn new things right?

Anyway, going directly to an example, try playing a "regular" sheet music (aka concert pitch sheet music) using your tenor saxophone and playing it in alto clef. Also, add 2 sharps to the key signature. (See key signature value technique)
What? You're using an alto saxophone? Okay try playing a "regular" sheet music using your alto saxophone and playing it in soprano clef. Also, add 3 sharps to the key signature. You should now sound correct.

Eh? You say you can just transpose the sheet music in a software? Well, yes, but I don't pay for a subscription on musescore because im cheapo, also most classical sheet music is in scanned format so. Also there's real books in a lot of jazz bars. Go learn that transposition lad.

Either way, here's a table of what clef you would use:
|Instrument | Reading from..   | Read as            | Key signature Modification |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
|Bb         | Concert (Treble) | Alto               | +2 Sharps                  |
|Eb         | Concert          | Soprano            | +3 Sharps                  |
|Bb         | Eb               | Mezzo Soprano clef | -1 Flats                   |

You can also use it if you are playing on an Alto Recorder if you dont wan't to learn a "second set of fingering"

|Instrument       | Reading from.. | Read as            |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
|Soprano Recorder | Concert        | Treble             |
|Alto Recorder    | Concert        | Mezzo Soprano      |

Clef transposition is actually related to the key signature value technique. I've written down what clef is needed for each modification type. I didn't update the table since it was in my journal and I am a lazy derg.

## Clef Transposition Table
---
| Modification (Sheet key, transpose direction) | Read as Clef
---
+ 6 Sharps (Gb): Mezzo Soprano(Sharp), Baritone (Flat) Clef (Play F# get C), Play F get B
+ 5 Sharps (Db): Tenor Clef (Play B get C)
+ 4 Sharps (Ab): Bass Clef (Play E get C)
+ 3 Sharps (Eb, M3 up): Soprano Clef (Play A get C)
+ 2 Sharps (Bb, M2 up): Alto Clef - (Play D get C)
+ 1 Sharp (F, P4 up): Baritone Clef (Play G for C)

No Modification (C): Treble Clef

- 1 Flats (G, P4 down): Mezzo Soprano Clef - Play F get C
- 2 Flats (D, M2 down): Tenor Clef - Play Bb get C, Play A get B
- 3 Flats (A): Bass Clef - Play Eb get C, Play D get B
- 4 Flats (E): Soprano Clef clef - Play Ab / G# get C, play G get B 
- 5 Flats (B): Alto Clef - Play Db get C, play F get E
- 6 Flats (F#): Mezzo Soprano / Baritone Clef - Play Gb get C, play F get B

- The same clef can be used for x sharps + y flats = 7

So how do you select what you need?
Let's start with Bb instrument

A Bb key sig has 2 flats. Our treble clef is 0. So we need to add 2 sharps to neutralize our Bb instrument into Treble.
Now look at the table for 2 sharps.
The 2 sharps corresponds to Alto Clef. So we read our concert sheet as Alto Clef to get concert pitch.
