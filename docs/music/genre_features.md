# Genre Features
This page is used to write down for reference what defines "each genre"
Sometimes, just saying "This makes you want to groove" isn't enough, I want to go deeper into them. Especially genres that I'm not familliar with (all of them)

## Classical
- I don't play classical enough to comment on this. But as far as I know, classical typically has a heavy focus on playing technique and perfection.
- In orchestras, players are often tasked with blending in with each other to form one unified sound. 

## Pop
- Repeat a chorus over and over, and finally break the pattern with a bridge to add some spice to the song.
- Often uses basic chords. Sometimes uses non-diatonic chords to stand out.

## Jazz
- Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz???

## Funk
- From 8-bit Music Theory: 
    - Rhythm: Heavy focus on 16th syncopation
    - Melody: Focus on Major pentatonic resolution (5->6->1)
    - Harmony: Focus on dominants, sometimes may even stay on I7 forever. You can also attempt double plagal cadences (ie IV -> I resolution twice, so bVII -> IV -> I)
    - Bassline: The bassline itself is basically another melody.

## Bebop
- Often uses a reverse swing pattern (instead of long short, it's short long eight notes!)
- Bebop stems from a test of virtuosity (fast hand movement while fitting to chord scales). So most songs are more like show off of techniques than actual "songs".
- To that end, bebop scales are made. They're basically scales... with 1 passing tone. I haven't really played bebop yet, though, so I can't comment on it.

## Bossa Nova
- Often uses Claves.
