# Music and Music Theory
I started learning music at around 2022 July, as a deterrent from playing more video games. These notes compile what I learned throughout.

The primary instruments that I currently learn is a Saxophone / (MIDI) Keyboard.

## Background fluff
Feel free to skip all this if you'd like, I just want to log down what happened.

I always wanted to play a saxophone except... wow, it's pricey! $1.2k? Seriously?

Anyway, I saw an ukulele store, and was like, sure, let's start with an ukulele, that sounds fun!
That storekeeper was really friendly, he quickly taught me the four basic chords: C, F, G, A. Fantastic! 

I had no idea what happened, but I did have fun. Except there was one problem.

What the hell am I supposed to do with this. What the hell is C, F, G, A. Huh?? I want to make songs, not what ever this backing sound is! This doesn't play songs! (I didn't know what a melody and chord was at the time)

???

So I put the ukulele aside and bought a MIDI keyboard. It's still being used to this day! Keyboards are fantastic for music theory and really lays out the entirety of music right in front of you.

Anyway, I kept on buying instruments, from a Recorder, to an Ocarina, to a Trumpet, to a Violin, to a Melodica, and finally.. I bit the bullet and bought a Saxophone, I guess there really just is a spiritual pull when an instrument calls for you haha.

Either way, long story short, good times, music did help reduce my game time and actually helped look for other avenues to spend time!
