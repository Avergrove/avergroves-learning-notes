# Chord scales Memorization
- Chord scales is a fundamental knowledge in Jazz. The gist is that you can fit your typical chord into any existing scale.. if they make sense.
- For example, with a C Major, we have C E G.
- The C Major scale has C D E F G A B C, which consist of all the notes in a C major 7, therefore C Major 7 fits the scale C Major.
- It also fits the C Lydian scale: C D E F# G A B C, which also consists of all notes in C Major 7. Therefore C Major 7 fits the C Lydian mode.
- We can keep things simple by grouping scales that fit together easily. 

## Method 1: The +- 1 method
- We know C Major fits a C major scale. But it also works well with the same scale of +- 1 to key signature. ie C Lydian.
- It's also one of the reasons why key signatures of perfect fifth interval tend to be "close" to each other.
- Similarly, we know C Minor 7 fits a C minor scale, but it also works well with the same scale of +- to key signature. ie C Dorian and C Phrygian.
- So by grouping in such a way, we get the following:

### Triads
| Chord | Scale          |
| ----- | -------------- |
| Maj   | Lydian         |
|       | Ionian (Major) |
|       | Mixolydian     |
|       |                |
| min   | Dorian         |
|       | Aeolian (Minor)|
|       | Phrygian       |

### Seventh chords
| Chord | Scale          |
| ----- | -------------- |
| Maj7  | Lydian         |
|       | Ionian (Major) |
|       |                |
| min7  | Dorian         |
|       | Aeolian (Minor)|
|       | Phrygian       |

- Notice that mixolydian is no longer available for Maj7, because the 7th gets flattened into a dominant chord.

## Method 2: The Dominant chord
The core of a 7 chord is the Mixolydian mode.
But, the 7th chord is typically used to make a part of a song sound unstable. In a strangely counterintuitive way, a seventh chord is considered "stable".

So we want to simply assign the three tension level of scales to the 7 chord:
- Mixolydian: The most stable scale that fits a dominant chord
- Diminished: The least stable possible scale that fits a dominant chord perfectly. 

## What about the other scales? (The special cases)
There's no way around this (yet as far as I'm aware), use them when you feel that you should. Just like learning TSDs in Tetris, you won't know when to use them if you never use it, so make sure to keep them in mind when experimenting!

### Altered Scale
- Altered scale is said to "fit" a dominant chord. However it will only fit if you want the chord to actually lead to something. Because the altered scale doesn't technically fit it perfectly.

### Harmonic Minor Scale
- An alternative option to the standard minor scale. It doesn't fit a standard min7. But it does fit a minmaj7, a chord that's used in spy flicks.

### Melodic Minor Scale
- Also doesn't fit the min7 chord directly. 

### Other scales
- This is getting into exotic territory and likely it's best you experiment with playing wrong notes more as you go.
