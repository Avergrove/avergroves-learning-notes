## Tone
What's a good tone? 

I'm going to make it sound really disgusting here.

First, listen to a recording, I started out listening to Grover Washington Jr, Take (Another) Five.

Wow, that sure is good tone, that sounds so smooth.. so .. buttery...

Great, so now let's imagine Grover is playing just like pressing toothpaste out of a tube.

When you press toothpaste out of it's tube, it sure is smooth right? I want you to imagine the toothpaste that is squeezed out is the tone. Try and aim for a sound that sounds like it's smooth, buttery toothpaste coming out of a tube.

Or you can imagine poop coming out of a butt.

Please squeeze out a nice, smooth, poop from a butt that shows your nutritional discipline instead of literal, crusty, musical doodoo poopoo full of holes.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
