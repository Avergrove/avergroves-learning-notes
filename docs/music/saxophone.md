# Saxophone
Melody section instrument in the jazz trifecta (Melody, rhythm, percussion)

## Fundamentals
By fundamentals, I mean embouchure and air support! 

These are the notes I collected from lessons:
Try and memorize this each time you start playing to get familliar to it!

### Embouchure: 
1) The neck should be facing forward, parallel to the floor, not the mouth
    - You might have a habit of tilting your head to fit it, don't. You should not have to move your head at all. Pretend you are talking to someone.
    - You can instead adjust how your saxophone is rotated later. But really don't move your head.
2) Put the lip at the point where the reed intersects with the mouth piece!
3) The lip contact point is right on the boundary line between wet flash and dry lip area.
4) Before you slide your mouth in, make the sound of "Ffffff"
5) Experiment and test how little muscle flexing you actually need to keep your embouchure in place.
    - Ideally, the side of your mouth is only for preventing the air from leaking out. Most of your gripping should be done with your "chin" muscles and philtrum muscle.

### Breath:
1) You should stop the air with your tongue. Not your throat
    - Failure to do this will result in the "ugh" sound. Which is very funny, but you definitely don't want that in a concert.
    - This follows up with the tip of breathing the air out with a "tu" sound
2) Breathing in: You should use deep breathing, this means you should feel your stomach inflating and your chest shouldn't rise up.
3) Breathing out: Brace your core, be ready to untongue, breathe out.
4) Exercising breathes: Try and put tissue paper on the wall at fist distance, and breathe out in a control manner getting the tissue to flutter smoothly in the air.

### Saxophone placement:
- When standing..
    1) Try and push the saxophone forward with *only your thumbs*. You should be able to rotate then the saxophone upwards and downwards into your mouth.
        - If the mouthpiece is on your nose / on your chin, you probably need to adjust your neck strap.
        - Remember, the "correct" position is that the neck is parallel to the floor, so try to adjust accordingly!
- When sitting down
    1) You may notice that your neck is now slanted. So to achieve "neck parallel to the ground", you rotate the mouthpiece.
        - So technically speaking, it's the mouthpiece we want to be parallel to the ground the whole time.

### Tonguing:
- You typically tongue on the "blunter" side of the tip of the tongue.
    - Using exactly the tip of the tongue is going to cause reed damage..

### Tone
- For high notes, use cold air (fast air)
- For low notes, use hot air (slow air)
    - Just remember air velocity affects reed vibration frequency.
- With everything in place, now overtone exercise should truly be difficult "by using correct technique"
