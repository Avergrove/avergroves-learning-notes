## Tone
What's a good tone? 

I'm going to make it sound really disgusting here.

First, listen to a recording, I started out listening to Grover Washington Jr, Take (Another) Five.

Wow, that sure is good tone, that sounds so smooth.. so .. buttery...

Great, so now let's imagine Grover is playing just like pressing toothpaste out of a tube.

When you press toothpaste out of it's tube, it sure is smooth right? I want you to imagine the toothpaste that is squeezed out is the tone. Try and aim for a sound that sounds like it's smooth, buttery toothpaste coming out of a tube.

Or you can imagine poop coming out of a butt.

Please squeeze out a nice, smooth, poop from a butt that shows your nutritional discipline instead of literal, crusty, musical doodoo poopoo full of holes.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

A good way to practice is using overtones. If you can play the second octave notes without using the octave key, it means you are pretty epic poggers and hit the tones correctly already. Now you just have to make the sound sound smooth and buttery.

## Vintage sax layout
Vintage saxophone layouts may have a different pinky finger layout. (Called left hand table keys)

My first saxophone was a selmer bundy, instoead of having 1-2-1 buttons in a rectangle formation, mine had a... 1-3 formation???

Anyway, from closest to you to furthest, they are the following: 
- C#, B, Bb
- Also, you need to hold down all regular keys for it to work.
- Also the C# is true hell for your pinky, but its okay i still love you bundy \<3
