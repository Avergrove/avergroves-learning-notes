I'm compiling my notes here I've written down from each of my lessons

## Phrasing
Phrasing is how well you play phrases. It sounds straightforward, but it's exactly what it is. 

The main advice is to avoid reading one note at a time, and instead read a whole phrase at once, and start singing like it's a sentence.

This is also a technique in sight reading. Because now by reading the whole sentence, you get an idea when the phrase starts and ends and make educated guesses.

Playing without phrasing will make you sound like a robot. As my teacher says..

"You are going DOOT-DOOT-DOOT-DOOT, it should be more smooth, like DoooTdooot doot dooot".

Even notes that are just basic four on the floor can be phrased. 

## Tone
What's a good tone? 

I'm going to make it sound really disgusting here.

First, listen to a recording, I started out listening to Grover Washington Jr, Take (Another) Five.

Wow, that sure is good tone, that sounds so smooth.. so .. buttery...

Great, so now let's imagine Grover is playing just like pressing toothpaste out of a tube.

When you press toothpaste out of it's tube, it sure is smooth right? I want you to imaging the toothpaste that is squeezed out is the tone. Try and aim  for a sound that sounds like it's smooth, buttery toothpaste coming out of a tube.

Or imagine poop from a butt.

Please squeeze out a nice, smooth, poop from a butt that shows your nutritional discipline instead of literal, crusty, musical doodoo poopoo full of holes.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
