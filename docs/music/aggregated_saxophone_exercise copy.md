# Genre Features
This page is used to write down for reference what defines "each genre"
Sometimes, just saying "This makes you want to groove" isn't enough, I want to go deeper into them. Especially genres that I'm not familliar with (all of them)


## Funk
- From 8-bit Music Theory: 
    - Rhythm: Heavy focus on 16th syncopation
    - Melody: Focus on Major pentatonic resolution (5->6->1)
    - Harmony: Focus on dominants, sometimes may even stay on I7 forever. You can also attempt double plagal cadences (ie IV -> I resolution twice, so bVII -> IV -> I)
    - Bassline: The bassline itself is basically another melody.
