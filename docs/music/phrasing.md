# Phrasing
Phrasing is how well you play (musical) phrases. It sounds stupidly exactly as what it says on the tin, but it's exactly what it is. 

The main advice is to avoid reading one note at a time, and instead read a whole phrase at once, and start singing like it's a sentence.

This is also a technique in sight reading (and improvisation). Because now by reading the whole sentence, you get an idea when the phrase starts and ends and make educated guesses.

Playing without phrasing will make you sound like a robot. As my teacher says..

"You are going DOOT-DOOT-DOOT-DOOT, it should be more smooth, like DoooTdooot doot dooot".

Even notes that are just basic four on the floor can be phrased. 

That probably sounded very vague, so if we want to drill into the specifics...

It's basically how well you perform ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release), and how well you connect bend each note into each other (or don't.) even without specific instructions on the sheet so that it sounds like you are speaking instead of say, roleplaying as a kindergartener reading ABCs...

Of course, before you can do all that, you need to learn to read fast enough first...
