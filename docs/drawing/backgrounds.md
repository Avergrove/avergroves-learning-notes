# Backgrounds

- Remember to respect composition when drawing the background. A fibonacci or third-separated canvas can separate an aimless or orderly-ed chaos drawing!
- It's perfectly fine to not jump straight to drawing each object, you can even represent your character as a block to check the perspective and size is correct!
- To show spatial relation between object, you will need **Cast shadows**
- Not technically backgrounds, but you can draw foregrounds, too!
- Don't forget you can exaggerate object features to make your objects look more interesting.
    - Example: A lamp post with a comically large lamp
