# Composition

The backbone of a drawing is composition. 
It's effectively the "line of action" at the macro level.

Composition describes the relation between occupied and empty space.
Composition is closely related to contrast

A drawing with a good composition can help the drawing look coherent.

A drawing without good composition will cause objects to look incoherent and have no relation to each other. (for example, sketchpages, which tend to look like drawings floating in nowhere.)

    - The page describes 15 styles of composition. Try and memorize them.. or don't, just revisit the page whenever you want!

Exercise 1: Instead of trying to copy a background, try drawing a background from a different angle or try remixing it!
    1a: In other words, try thinking of a composition for the reference picture, and whip it up using the reference.
    1b: Try forcing compositions that you feel "won't work" and force it to work.
