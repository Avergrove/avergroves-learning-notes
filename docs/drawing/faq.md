Frequently asked questions

- Why does my background drawing look rigid?
    - Composition! A drawing without composition will fail to grab and flow the viewers attention.
    - Ideally each less focused area should be pointing towards a focused area.
    - Another way is to instead of draw background, also draw a foreground!
    - Dont be a coward: It only takes 15 seconds to compose and draw a barebones background (3 shapes!). Just like poses, it doesn't have to be detailed, it just has to look interesting.
        - If you dont like it, it's only 15 seconds!
    - Even your human can be just a block...
