# Bleeding Hearts
Bleeding hearts is the reversed mod for Duos! It's only available on Valentines day.

- Ruleset:
    - Lines you send are also sent to each other.
    - The catch is that lines are entirely uncancellable, both from your teammate and from enemies!
    - Garbage is expert mode (Garbage delay is short, and pops up immediately instead of slowly increasing row by row)

- (WIP) General guideline:
    - Avoid back to backs, they cause the garbage to increase in height a lot more quickly than intended.
    - Opener: 
        - One person should build a 9-0, up to a quad.
    - Ideal board state:
        - Both players should send this quad. The other player will pass this quad back.
        - The other pieces are used to single skim anything from above, breaking back to back.
        - Any higher rows are skimmed off, **breaking back to back**.
            - We don't want back to back because this will cause the garbage stack to grow over time. There's plenty of external garbage coming in already.
    - Recovery: 
        - Avoid back to back because this causes quad to send 5 instead of 4, making the garbage height increase overall.
        - If one player is high, the other is low, it's fine for the high to send a quad to the low.
            - This allows the downstacking work to be distributed to both players.
            - Avoid sending more quads to the high player, it will cause a garbage cascade as the high player might be forced to send back to back quads. 
        - If both players are high, you can still send quads to each other, but try and avoid back to back and over-doing it.
