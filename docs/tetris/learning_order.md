# Learning Order
Of course, you can play tetris just by spamming regular tetris but... why not learn more?

## Preliminary setup

### The Learning order
#### Fundamentals
- Start with the 40 line sprint: Try and aim for a time of 2:30 if you can. To achieve that, learn the following:
    - Flat stacking: I know it's easier for me to say this than do but... yes, it literally just means keep the field flat. Flat fields can accomodate more types of pieces. 9-0 stacking is lenient enough that you don't have to overthink about your queue.
    - 9-0 Stacking: This basically means leaving the tetris hole on the right. 
        - Why right over left? Because the pieces spawn biassed to the right. I never confirmed this but if they say so, it... probably is so.
    - Twists: Learn it. It will make your stacking life much easier and open up more options.
- I'm making these times very lenient, because I want you to be interested in learning all the extra stuff! Speed will always come naturally, so don't stress about it.
- Once you can clear 40 lines, try and perform the following 40 lines... (again, don't stress about the time!):
    - Using only Tetrisses (Quads)
    - Without using hold. 
    - Without finesse errors (See Auxillary fundamentals)

#### Auxillary Fundamentals
- I'm putting these here because it's important to learn these early on before your muscle memory kicks in.
- Handling: DAS, ARR and SDF. Similar to Finesse, try and change as soon as possible. These are only available in non-guideline games. 
- Keybinds: I use a scheme of WASD + IJKL (Left/right + Hard drop / Soft drop   \<--\> Rotate CCW / CW + Hold / 180 degree rotation). Why did I use this scheme? Well honestly I don't know, it just felt intuitive to change it to this way when I first started..
- Finesse: This is how efficient you move to each position / orientation with least key presses. This should be learned **as early as possible** before muscle memory kicks in.

#### Stack Learning Order
- Start with 9-0, then learn 6-3, then 7-2, and then finally leave 5-4 and 8-1 for last.

#### Openers
- To keep it simple, just learn TKI. You only need the first TSD to cancel your opponent's opener. 
    - TETR.IO has a double defense system if you send lines for 14 lines and under, only if you havent sent any yet.
    - ie a single TSD is going to defend against 8 lines at the start of the game (!)

#### Tspins
- Once you can do 9-0, start looking into basic T-spins! This is where you can read up as much as you want.
- Learn the basic TSD: Imagine a T-shaped hole, then cover one side and slot in!

After learning the basic TSD, you can start diverging into different subjects..
- Openers: 
    - In theory, you only need two openers, TKI and MS2. TKI is a versatile opener that opens a match with a TSD so you can survive into the midgame. MS2 is a 100% build rate opener with a high PC rate that can enter a DPC loop.
    - However, you can learn some extra ones if you'd like.. 
    - PCO: You can learn PCO for fun and giggles since it teaches you how to perform t-spins and twists, but I wouldn't look too deep into it though since perfect clears aren't reliable in games.
        - If you want to feel really cool, search for the Jigsaw loop. It's essentially a loop that can walys be set up, performing 2 perfect clears into a DPC.
    - MKO: A freestyle opener that smoothly leads into 6-3 stacking.
- Donations: These are TSDs performed by covering the 9 0 hole.

#### Skims
- Skims break b2b, but breaking b2b is better than not achieving anything. So go learn them! Some skims can help kick start your b2b, these are skimming tsd setups.
    - Grim Grotto: Using a hanging J or L piece to create a 1-wide hole. Perfect for TSDs and can even create STSD slots when you overbuild!
        - Shallow Grave: An extension of Grim grotto that forms the basic unit of Hyper Fractals.
    - Dejavu: A skim that creates a donut shape, thereby creating a TSD hole on completion.
#### Advanced subjects
- These are the major stacking styles used in different scenarios. They all involve using specific pieces to create a pattern on one side and using the other pieces in the stack on the other side for improvisation.
    - ST Stacking: Four.lol says this is a great for beginners to learn and... honestly it is. It's also very painful. Also I can't do it consistently either.
    - LST Stacking:
    - Hyper Fractal: You don't actually have to use this because it actually breaks b2b, but it's extremely useful regardless because it helps creates TSDs. It also helps you get famillar with creating TSD slots with Grim Grotto.
