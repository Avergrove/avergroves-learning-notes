# Late Game
This game talks about the late game when either cheese or clean is hitting the extreme.

## Extreme clean
A game where clean is sent back to each other over and over again. This will result in a tall stack with high dependencies on I piece.

You should pay attention to your opponent's pieces! 9-0 situations a lot due to random garbage. If your opponent is holding 2x I-pieces, they are forced to drop one.
If you are high, obviously you want to cancel it.
If you aren't, it's a good idea to force your opponent to spend their I piece to attack you. Then counterattack back so now they have +4 lines again!

## Extreme Cheese
A game where there is so much cheese neither can attack effectively.

There's not a lot to say here, I hope you practiced your cheese race!
