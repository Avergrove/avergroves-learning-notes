# Rank Studies
- These are suggested learning according to each rank, based on my experience, you can of course skip ahead to upper level topics if you want!

## C Rank
- Go practice clean stacking! Try and finish 40l sprints in 2.5 minutes.
    - Clean stacking basically means stacking flat! What is stacking flat? Well, there's no pattern answer... just avoid making hills!

## B rank
- Just learn to stack cleanly and send tetrisses, you will be fine!
    - Try and learn to do a 40 line by only sending Tetrisses.
    - In addition try to finish 40l by doing the following:
        - No hold
        - 
- Also, go learn finesse, it will make your piece placement much, much more fluid.
- Also, have a look at <b>spin / twist moves</b>! There are plenty of holes you can fit your blocks in with a little bit of rotation..
    - Using the Perfect Clear Opener will teach you these, you don't have to use this in game, but it's still fun to learn spins along with it!

## A rank
- You *might* start seeing some opener mains, but you will be mostly fine regardless.
- You can start learning 6-3 stacking (and other column stacking) now if you want, you don't have to use it, it's just for getting used to it!
    - You will be converting into different stack types a lot after a downstack
    - Once again, go practice this in 40L sprints!
- Speaking of which.. it's an extremely good idea to practicing downstacking! I practice downstacking using Dig in Techmino in my free time.
    - (You can unlock Dig either by playing the game normally, or using the console command to unlock all modes.)
- Feel free to start learning TSDs! Go for some natural ones if you'd like. The core rule of thumb is that *Do not compromise your stack for a TSD, it's not always worth it*
- You can also start looking into openers! I categorize them into two types: Freestyle and Kill openers.. but don't look too much into them.

## S Rank
- It is now extremely important to learn <b>Offense and Defense</b>.
- You will also start seeing player specialization surfacing here: Opener mains, 4 widers, 2-widers, Perfect clearers, you will see them all here!

### Offense
- Chances are your opponent also has some decent downstacking skill now! But, if you time your attacks correctly, you might just be able to top them out..
- Timing: This means paying attention to when your opponent is vulnerable. If you send your attacks while they are low, you are giving them free ammo to send back to you, so again, if you see a TSD, it doesn't mean you have to take it!
- Pressuring: On the flipside, if your opponent is having trouble downstacking, then it's a fantastic time to attack!
- Spiking: It's a good idea to learn spiking too, Caboozled_pie and KezDaBez has a great video that quickly runs down on spiking

    - Sending spikes while your opponent stacks high is a great way to catch them by surprise! Pay attention to when they are building and when they don't have an answer to your spike.
        - Are they covering the well?
        - Do they have a TSD or Tetris to defend?

### Defense
- There is an extremely likely chance that your opponent will start the game with (Extended) SDPC / Nakamura's Voracity and Stickspin, you will need to learn how to handle them appropriately in order to advance the ranks!
- Early game defense: So the first thing you want to do is survive the early game. The generic game plan is set up and TSD or Tetris as soon as possible
    - Then, wait for a bit! It's a bit awkward having to look at that TSD slot and do nothing with it, BUT, the alternative is dying, or worse, you send clean garbage and give your opponent more firepower, think carefully before sending that TSD / Tetris!
- Mid-game defense: Most spikes are about 10 height high. So if you build below 10 blocks, you should be mostly safe, but...
    - If you are building at 7 blocks high already, it is highly advised that you make sure you have a defense response at all time. That means either making sure the well is always open, or having a T-spin slot on hand!
    - Getting caught by surprise while at high height without any response is a death sentence, always be prepared and have a response!
- Tanking: On the flipside, if you are low on the board, it's not a bad idea to accept opponent garbage, but take note what type of garbage it is:
    - If your opponent is using a combo setup... you out of luck, combo setups will send cheese garbage and are notoriously hard to downstack!
    - If your opponent is using a spike setup... Excellent! If you accept some of their garbage, you will automatically have a pre-built well available to use!
- Observation: Pay attention to your opponent's play style:
    - Do they use kill openers?
        - Cancel and accept garbage appropriately, try and keep your stack low, cancel, and reach the garbage hole, cancel again
    - Are they going for combos? 
        - Cancel the early combos as they are cheesier, the later lines will send less cheesy garbage.
    - Are they *waiting* for you to do something? 
        - Why are they waiting? Do they have something prepared? 
        - If they are trying to survive and cancel you, you will always have more time than them as long as you are lower on the board. They are forced to move!
        - If they are trying to spike you... well, keep building! But build cleanly.

### Other recommended learning topics
- No hold stacking: You need to learn to stack without using hold to hold onto that T or I piece. Do skims if you have to!
- The openers I use at this point in time is the following:
    - TKI (Early I): Early TSD makes good defense against anything! The early TSD is also a bit detrimental however if you just send it without any follow ups..
    - MKO (Early LJ): Slightly later TSD but still good, teaches 6-3 stacking!
    - <a href="https://four.lol/openers/hachispin">Hachispin</a> (Early O): It's a Single-Triple! But more importantly, this is the foil to SDPC and Stickspin as those use early-O too. Cancels whatever they send and helps create a clean stack!
    - 6-3 (Early SZT): Not technically an opener, but it's a good way to start a game in general.
    - The main thing these all have in common is that they *freestyle openers* they help you survive early game and have versatile options afterwards. (Downstack? 6-3? LST Stack?)
- In addition, you should also study what the kill openers does so you can time properly:
    - SDPC (Extended SDPC, Nakamuraa's Voracity)
    - Stickspin (Stickspin)
    - Kill openers can become a crutch if overused. Please don't end up as a 3pps opener to 0.8 pps mid-gamer..
