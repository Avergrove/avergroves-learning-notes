# 7-2 Stacking - ST / LST Stacking
7 columns on the left, 2 columns on the right (or vice versa.)

The main gimmick of using 7-2 stacks is that you will usually only be using one or two piece type on the 2 side, depending on ST or LST stacking style.
So 7-2 stacks become a game of balancing your remaining 5/6 piece types on the 6 side.

The two main stacking type for 7-2 stacking is ST and LST stacking.


## ST Stacking

According to four.lol, ST stacking is something that can be learned by anyone in anytime, because it promotes good queue watching. And they're right.

The gist is simple, slap an S or Z on one of the sides, and get stacking hearts on center and freestyle on the side.
In theory, everything will happen smoothly, the hearts go on center, the rest goes on side.

In practice, mixing happens a lot. Also attempting to use your S/Z piece on the main stack will easily cause a huge dependency and height difference, thereby terminating your stack.

ST stacking is still useful to learn even outside of 7-2 stacks since you can get a 2-side scenario occasionally in 6-3 and 5-4 stacks.

## LST Stacking
Just like ST stacking, but now with L and S on the side. Note you don't really build hearts in the middle anymore, but instead try to build alternating 1-2 sawtooth gaps in the center.

In theory, stacking Ls and Ss long with Js and Zs will automatically do this for you. In practice, this is a luxury, most of the time you need to improvise mixing between the center and the right.

"Doubling up" is when you stack double S/Zs on the LST side. You usually do this when there begins to be a height difference on the LST side and the other side.

Realistically, despite being called LST, you really should be using every tool in your disposal to keep TSD-ing! Go for donations, ST Stacks, Purple Rains -> Yoshihiro SD!

## Purple Rain -> Yoshihiro SD
Sometimes you just have too many Ts in your queue bunched up together. Or maybe your two side is just dead flat, or of similar height difference to your 7 side and makes ST / LST difficult.

Enter Purple Rain, the technique is an T-spin SSD (Single, Single, Double) that will help add jaggedness back into your 2 stack again and hopefully get your momentum back in spamming T-spins.

For purple rain to work, you need to have a 1-block difference to the next hole.

- Easily buildable when you 2-side is flat. Just slap on a J/L + SZ piece and you are good to go!
- The remaining overhang can be handled in the following way:
    - Build a 4-wide combo (not very strong in TETR.IO unless you have a well to utilize at the end)
    - Anchor set: This doesn't really do "anything" on its own. It's mainly for counting to four to retain back to back
        - Prophecy: If you know you are going to go this route, you can attempt to setup a TSD donation above. 
    - Kaidan: If you used an S/Z pieces as your overhang, then you can pretend you are performing a Kaidan, just fill up the overhang side and do what you did in 9-0 stacking.
    - S/Z spin: With TETR.IO's all spin update, this is actually a strong option. You can also T-spin in if you need to, of course.
