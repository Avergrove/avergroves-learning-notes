# 7-2 Stacking - ST / LST Stacking
7 columns on the left, 2 columns on the right (or vice versa.)

The main gimmick of using 7-2 stacks is that you will usually only be using one or two piece type on the 2 side, depending on ST or LST stacking style.
So 7-2 stacks become a game of balancing your remaining 5/6 piece types on the 6 side.

The two main stacking type for 7-2 stacking is ST and LST stacking.


## ST Stacking

According to four.lol, ST stacking is something that can be learned by anyone in anytime, because it promotes good queue watching. And they're right.

The gist is simple, slap an S or Z on one of the sides, and get stacking hearts on center and freestyle on the side.
In theory, everything will happen smoothly, the hearts go on center, the rest goes on side.

In practice, mixing happens a lot. Also attempting to use your S/Z piece on the main stack will easily cause a huge dependency and height difference, thereby terminating your stack.

ST stacking is still useful to learn even outside of 7-2 stacks since you can get a 2-side scenario occasionally in 6-3 and 5-4 stacks.

## LST Stacking
Just like ST stacking, but now with L and S on the side. Note you don't really build hearts in the middle anymore, but instead try to build alternating 1-2 sawtooth gaps in the center.

In theory, stacking Ls and Ss long with Js and Zs will automatically do this for you. In practice, this is a luxury, most of the time you need to improvise mixing between the center and the right.

For me, LST was more intuitive and "more lenient" since you can build fractals and stall by "doubling up" Ss and Zs while waiting for Ts. Unlike ST stacking, the height usually won't flunctuate too dramatically even with a dependency.

## Hybrid stacking
I don't think this really has a name yet.

In a real game if you have less experience (like me), it's more likely you will use a mix of the two. This can be done by first building the 7 side with either 1 or 2 gaps, then build the left accordingly. This will allow you to use a mixture of Ls for one-gaps, and Ss for two gaps.

You can also use 4-gaps, this functions like a double-up as in LST.

I guess you can call it a form of prophesizing.


## Purple Rain
Sometimes you just have too many Ts in your queue bunched up together. Or maybe your two side is just dead flat, or of similar height difference to your 7 side and makes ST / LST difficult.

Enter Purple Rain, the technique is an T-spin SSD (Single, Single, Double) that will help add jaggedness back into your 2 stack again and hopefully get your momentum back in spamming T-spins.
