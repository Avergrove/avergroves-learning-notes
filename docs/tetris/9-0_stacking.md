# 9-0 Stacking
- The beginner recommendation. There's a surprising number of techniques outside of just building Tetris(s).
- 9-0 is also relatively forgiving when stacking, the wide left well allows you to be a bit more reckless with your pieces as there will likely by large flat areas.

## Techniques
### Natural donation:
Basically cover the well with any piece, really.

To keep it simple, try donating just TSDs. This means any piece that is 1/2 tile tall is fair-play for covering the well up. (S/Z/O and J/Ls on its side)
Using 3 pieces will leave a residue at the well and require you to do a TST or two t-spins in a row, both are a long commitment before you can quad downstack.

### Kaidan
You will see this EXTREMELY often. It's also easy to identify! Kaidan means stairs, so just look for stairs and slap an S

### Reverse Yoshihiro SD
Also an extremely common occurence. Basically at any point in time when you see a 3-wide wall distance, 1 height wall, you can perform an EZSpin on the well to send a TSS and create a Tshaped hole.

### Yoshihiro SD
I wrote reverse Yoshihiro SD first because it's easier to pull off. Yoshihiro SD will first require and L/J piece before you can start sending your Tspins!

### ST Stacking
Surprisingly enough, because ST stacking generates a well in the last hole, it's an entirely reasonable pick!

### Hamburger stacking
It's ST stacking but more horizontal. The same chiptooth shapes in ST stacking works in hamburger, too!

### Shachiku Train
Shachiku train is available when your wall distance is 4 and height difference is 2.

Shachiku train is a fairly dangerous donation maneuver, it requires an S first, then an L piece, then two t pieces! 

Shachiku train is extremely strong in downstacking if each hole is in a chess horsey pattern moving in one direction.

Shachiku train is effectively hamburger stacking with an L to complete the TSD.

Unfortunately, Shachiku train cannot be chained unless you use an 8-1 well or lower.

#### Putting hamburger and Shachiku together:
- In practice, this means you can always toss the S piece on the right side of the stack. 
    - If it's a 3-distance, it's hamburger
    - If it's a 4-distance, make sure you have an L available.
- Then just make your T-spin slot and continue on with your day.

### 4 Wide
4-wide is a technique that is always available regardless of well. 
In TETR.IO, combos apply a multiplier to your lines sent.

This means as long as you build a 4wide on top of your tetris well, you should be able to send a whooping 12 lines with a single tetris after the combo!
(Of course you still need to learn how to 4 wide..)

### Iverhang
You might be wondering if you can possibly to TSTs with a 9-0 well.. the answer is.. yes! Although it's tricky.

Iverhang is not a typo. It's a mixture of overhang and I piece. Sometimes you may wonder, how do I make a T spin triple on 9-0 well? Well, here's your answer!

- To build an Iverhang, you need a funnel shape. The well that leads to the TST must be as thin as possible. 
- First, build a bridge to the right, then, put an I piece. Finally, do a mid air line clear.
- To avoid triggering a line clear, build the bridge as soon as possible before building the left.
- It's easy in theory, in practice, however.. this may be best done with two i pieces.
