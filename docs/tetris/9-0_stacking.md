# 9-0 Stacking
- The beginner recommendation. There's a surprising number of techniques outside of just building Tetris(s).
- 9-0 is also relatively forgiving when stacking, the wide left well allows you to be a bit more reckless with your pieces as there will likely by large flat areas.

#### Natural donation:
Basically cover the well with any piece, really.

To keep it simple, try donating just TSDs. This means any piece that is 2 tile tall is fair-play for covering the well up. (S/Z/O and J/Ls on its side)
Using 3 pieces will leave a residue at the well and require you to do a TST or two t-spins in a row.

#### Kaidan
You will see this EXTREMELY often. It's also easy to identify! Kaidan means stairs, so just look for stairs and slap an S

#### Reverse Yoshihiro SD
Also an extremely common occurence. Basically at any point in time when you see a 3-wide wall distance, 1 height wall, you can perform an EZSpin on the well to send a TSS and create a Tshaped hole.

#### Yoshihiro SD
I wrote reverse Yoshihiro SD first because it's easier to pull off. Yoshihiro SD will first require and L/J piece before you can start sending your Tspins!

#### Hamburger chain
An option when you have a wide wall distance on the side, while having a two tall block.
It has a very distinct shape: like an ant's head with S/Zs as the feeler and it acts as a TSS attack.

An interesting thing about Hamburger stacking is that it can be chained into intself.

#### Shachiku Train
Shachiku train is available when your wall distance is 4 and height difference is 2.

Shachiku train is a fairly dangerous donation maneuver, it requires an S first, then an L piece, then two t pieces! 

Shachiku train is extremely strong in downstacking if each hole is in a chess horsey pattern moving in one direction.

Shachiku train is effectively hamburger stacking with an L to complete the TSD.

Unfortunately, Shachiku train cannot be chained unless you use an 8-1 well or lower.

#### Putting hamburger and Shachiku together:
- In practice, this means you can always toss the S piece on the right side of the stack. 
    - If it's a 3-distance, it's hamburger
    - If it's a 4-distance, make sure you have an L available.
- Then just make your T-spin slot and continue on with your day.

### 4 Wide
4-wide is a technique that is always available regardless of well. 
In TETR.IO, combos apply a multiplier to your lines sent.

This means as long as you build a 4wide on top of your tetris well, you should be able to send a whooping 12 lines with a single tetris after the combo!
(Of course you still need to learn how to 4 wide..)

### Extras
#### "Advanced TST Props"
- From Galactoids page. These are primarily used in 9-0 stacking.

- This works incredible well in 4x1 holes and beyond (eg 5x1, 6x1)
    - But it's primarily for 4x1

- Go memorize them, really!
