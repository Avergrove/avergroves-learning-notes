# DPC
This page describes tips you can use to quickly determine what to use.

The chinese tetris wiki has a lot more explanation on DPC other than the minimal ones, also as titbit, it explains where the names come from!

## DPC Tips
### Extra I DPC
#### Which should I use?
- I DPC is painful, so let's learn the simpler set first!

##### I DPC: Set 1
- I DPC in general is a mess. So let's try to memorize it properly!

- Ordered by brainpower needed. 

Example: O -> I means O piece comes before I.

- 1: O -> I (Fake Butter DPC)
- else:: I -> O 
    - 2: J -> O, S -> Z (Pelican DPC) 
    - 3: J -> O, Z -> S (Stick DPC)
- otherwise, I -> O, also O -> JL (Unnamed DPC)

- 4: JL -> O -> I (Kuruma DPC, Optional but it's a reusable solution for SZ and O DPC)

- Fake butter DPC (O -> I)
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to J/L, 
            - If orange L, put I and O on left
            - If blue J, put I and O on right
    - Solve: There's only one easy solution!
        - LOJ box on left, OSZ glob in center, T piece as cake on top, and I piece on far right.

- I DPC is painful, learn them one by one. It's crucial you pay attention to piece order.
- Pelican DPC
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to S/Z
            - If green S, put I on right.
            - If red Z, put I on left
    - Solve:
        - Basic solve: Only the OSZ glob needs to be varied.
        - If you are feeling poggers: There's extra solutions for extra speens!
            - You only need an early L/J to form the TSD groove at the bottom.
- Stick DPC:
    - Solve: The I and T is always at the same spot.
        - Solve 1: First place S/Z pointing towards I side. Create two hearts: S/Z heart on I side, O heart on T side.
        - Solve 2: First place the O heart on I side, then place J/L lying flat, spin S and Z in.
        - You might need 180 for this..

- Bonus: Kuruma DPC (JL -> O -> I)
    - It's kuruma again, shared by SZ, and O DPC! Beautiful!
    - Pay attention to the early JL to know you can use it.
    - TSD: Anyway it's simple, put I on one side, build hamburger on that side. JL should be pointing towards each other with the lower pointing at wall.
    - Solving it is easy, just build an LOJ box. You can figure out the rest.



### OSZ Ball DPC (Extra T DPC)
- The OSZ ball shape is entirely interchangeable. But you need to pay attention to how the J and L piece blocks your piece placement.
Pay attention to the order of the SZO
- If SZ comes first, stack them vertically.
- If O comes first, check if S or Z comes first, if S comes first, then use the O to create an S groove (hole) at the bottom
    - Then you can Z-spin, + S-spin + Perfect clear!
- If SOZ (O sandwiched between SZ).. 
    - put your S flat on the ground first.

### Extra JL DPC

### Extra O DPC
- Kuruma DPC:
    - TSD: To determine which side to put the O piece, pay attention to the first JL! 
    - PC: The O is always fixed one side. 

### Extra SZ DPC
- Lime DPC is painful to solve, you might want to look into alternatives whenever possible.
    - There's a recovery on the Simplified Jigsaw loop that should help you loop back but... it has terrible scoring.
        - However, it *does* complete the loop, it just doesn't TSD or Quad at all..
    - Alternatives (All of them have wtf requirements):
        - God DPC: *both* J/L must come before second S, O must come after S!
        - Out of Order TKI DPC
            - J -> I
            - L -> S2 -> O -> Z
        - Extra S TKI: 
            - These requirements are getting more and more obtuse..
            - L -> S2
            - I -> J -> Z
        - TSD DPC:
            - Unique to S DPC.
            - O -> second S, this is the same as Kuruma DPC
            - to quote John Beak:
                - Comparison to Kuruma DPC:
                    - Better for Blitz, high gravity, average setup score, high PPB Ultra, and when followed up by 1st PC/Jigsaw.
                    - Worse for VS, speed, low KPP, low softdrop rate, b2b, consistency, and when followed up by Gamushiro & friends 8L.
        - Hold O TKI DPC: 
            - I -> S2
            - J -> O
        - Fake Butter DPC:
            - I -> O, Z/J -> L
            - This one is a lot more reasonable than it sounds. And is surprisingly reasonable.
            - Also, it's shared by I DPC, so might as well learn it.
        - JB DPC:
            - Unique to extra S DPC
            - Adds a layer of avoidance to Lime DPC: Z -> S -> O
            - Basically all you need is Z to come before S now!
    - So really your only option is lime dpc or.. whatever the hell above is, AND you might still have to do Lime DPC!
- Anyway, back to Lime DPC Solves:
    - You can use this site to practice: https://himitsuconfidential.github.io/downstack-practice/usermode.html/__________=S,*p7,*p7
    - Jstris has blood lime setup for practice: https://jstris.jezevec10.com/play/mode/2589
    - This guide assumes the Green lime (Extra S) orientation. Let's group up the solutions:
        - Tip #1: The I piece is ALWAYS at the center.
    - Solve Note 1: Pay attention to the left cavity:
        - Solution Group 1: JO on left cavity (J points towards the wall, then put O):
            - Solution #1: The first solution is the most symmetrical: 
                - SZT on the right. Solve the rest.
            - Solution #2: Your T came late. So you need to do a slightly fancy solve: 
                - Place the L pointing to the center, 
                - other S piece standing vertically in the corner for a fancy clear. Solve the rest.
        - Solution Group 2: ZJ on left cavity.
            - Solution #1: ST at bottom, LO at top, it's very neat and clean.
            - Solution #2: Fancy solve - L points towards center just like in group 1 again, clearing an O piece instead of S. Solve the rest
        - Solution Group 4: Weird L piece on left cavity.
            - Solution #1: OL on left cavity. 
                - Do a fancy solve like in 1-2, except this time it's S and T-piece facing up. Solve the rest.
                - Memorization tip: Both use O in the cavity.
            - Solution #2: SL on left cavity.
                - Remember this sequence of left to right pieces: OJZ. Solve the rest.
    
    - Solve Note 2: Filling in the left cavity first will not always work.. you should try and fit the right side first, then see if the remaining pieces fit that on the left. even then that will still not work, you need to really know how to look ahead.
        - First: Is it possible to do a "fancy" line clear? As long as the lower part of the left cavity is filled, you can now do fancy line clear.
        - Second: Did a T piece come early? There's only 2 positions for early T piece. Otherwise, it's the other solutions.
        - Third: The O piece is the most troublesome because it has so many configurations.
