The chinese tetris wiki has a lot more explanation on DPC other than the minimal ones, also as titbit, it explains where the names come from!

## DPC Tips
### Extra I DPC
#### Which should I use?
- I DPC is painful, so let's learn the simpler set first!

##### I DPC: Set 1
- I DPC in general is a mess. So let's try to memorize it properly!

- Ordered by brainpower needed. 

Example: O -> I means O piece comes before I.

- 1: O -> I (Fake Butter DPC)
- else:: I -> O 
    - 2: J -> O, S -> Z (Pelican DPC) 
    - 3: J -> O, Z -> S (Stick DPC)
- otherwise, I -> O, also O -> JL (Unnamed DPC)

- 4: JL -> O -> I (Kuruma DPC, Optional but it's a reusable solution for SZ and O DPC)

- Fake butter DPC (O -> I)
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to J/L, 
            - If orange L, put I and O on left
            - If blue J, put I and O on right
    - Solve: There's only one easy solution!
        - LOJ box on left, OSZ glob in center, T piece as cake on top, and I piece on far right.

- I DPC is painful, learn them one by one. It's crucial you pay attention to piece order.
- Pelican DPC
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to S/Z
            - If green S, put I on right.
            - If red Z, put I on left
    - Solve:
        - Basic solve: Only the OSZ glob needs to be varied.
        - If you are feeling poggers: There's extra solutions for extra speens!
            - You only need an early L/J to form the TSD groove at the bottom.
- Stick DPC:
    - Solve: The I and T is always at the same spot.
        - Solve 1: First place S/Z pointing towards I side. Create two hearts: S/Z heart on I side, O heart on T side.
        - Solve 2: First place the O heart on I side, then place J/L lying flat, spin S and Z in.
        - You might need 180 for this..

- Bonus: Kuruma DPC (JL -> O -> I)
    - It's kuruma again, shared by SZ, and O DPC! Beautiful!
    - Pay attention to the early JL to know you can use it.
    - TSD: Anyway it's simple, put I on one side, build hamburger on that side. JL should be pointing towards each other with the lower pointing at wall.
    - Solving it is easy, just build an LOJ box. You can figure out the rest.



### OSZ Ball DPC (Extra T DPC)
Pay attention to the order of the SZO
- If SZ comes first, stack them vertically.
- If O comes first, check if S or Z comes first, if S comes first, then use the O to create an S groove (hole) at the bottom
    - Then you can Z-spin, + S-spin + Perfect clear!
- If SOZ (O sandwiched between SZ).. 
    - put your S flat on the ground first.

### Extra JL DPC

### Extra O DPC
- Kuruma DPC:
    - TSD: To determine which side to put the O piece, pay attention to the first JL! 
    - PC: The O is always fixed one side.
