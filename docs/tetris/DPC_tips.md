### Extra I DPC
#### Which should I use?
- I DPC is painful, so let's learn the simpler set first!

##### I DPC: Set 1
- 1: O -> I (Fake Butter DPC)
- 2: I -> O ( JL -> O ) (Pelican DPC)

- It's VERY important that you make sure you can't build Fake Butter DPC and Pelican DPC first before doing TKI DPc, otherwise it won't work!

- Fake butter DPC (O -> I)
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to J/L, 
            - If orange L, put I and O on left
            - If blue J, put I and O on right
    - Solve: There's only one easy solution!
        - LOJ box on left, OSZ glob in center, T piece as cake on top, and I piece on far right.

- I DPC is painful, learn them one by one. It's crucial you pay attention to piece order.

- Ordered by brainpower needed. 
- 1: O -> I (Fake Butter DPC)
- 2: I -> O ( O -> J/L) (Unnamed DPC, Io Jello)
- 3: I -> O ( O -> L, S -> Z) (Pelican DPC)
- 3: I -> O ( O -> L, Z -> S) (Stick DPC)

- 4: JL -> O -> I (Kuruma DPC, Optional but it's a reusable solution for SZ and O DPC)

- Genral
    - TSD: You more or less just imagine orange has to go left, blue has to go right.
- Kuruma DPC (JL -> O -> I)
    - It's kuruma again, shared by SZ, and O DPC! Beautiful!
    - TSD: Anyway it's simple, put I on one side, build hamburger on that side. JL should be pointing towards each other with the lower pointing at wall.
    - Solving it is easy, just build an LOJ box. You can figure out the rest.
- Pelican DPC
    - TSD Section:
        - To determine correct side, pay attention to S/Z
            - If green S, put I on right.
            - If red Z, put I on left
    - Solve:
        - Basic solve: Only the OSZ glob needs to be varied.
        - If you are feeling poggers: There's extra solutions for extra speens!
            - You only need an early L/J to form the TSD groove at the bottom.
- Stick DPC:
    - Solve: The I and T is always at the same spot.
        - Solve 1: First place S/Z pointing towards I side. Create two hearts: S/Z heart on I side, O heart on T side.
        - Solve 2: First place the O heart on I side, then place J/L lying flat, spin S and Z in.
        - You might need 180 for this..
- Unnamed DPC
    - TSD: Prioritize the J/L piece that sits on the O piece and points towards the wall.
    - Solve: Only has one solution, nice. 
        - Toss the O into the groove to the right, and I to the left. 
        - S/Z will be hanging off their ledges.
        - T piece is smack dab in the center
        - So you only need to solve the JL



### OSZ Ball DPC (Extra T DPC)
Pay attention to the order of the SZO
- If SZ comes first, stack them vertically.
- If O comes first, check if S or Z comes first, if S comes first, then use the O to create an S groove (hole) at the bottom
    - Then you can Z-spin, + S-spin + Perfect clear!
- If SOZ (O sandwiched between SZ).. 
    - put your S flat on the ground first.

### Extra JL DPC

### Extra O DPC
- Kuruma DPC:
    - TSD: To determine which side to put the O piece, pay attention to the first JL! 
    - PC: The O is always fixed one side.
