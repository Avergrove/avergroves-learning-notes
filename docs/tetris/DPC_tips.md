## DPC Tips
### Extra I DPC
#### Which should I use?
- Pay attention to the mnemonic
    - O < I    (Oi!)
    - JL < O   (Jello)
    - I < O < L   (I can't spell oil)

- OI DPC Structure (Fake Butter, whatever that is):
    - Remember to use 2x standing SZ pieces to create a TSD slot
    - Blue J on the right. That means I piece must be on the right.
    - Place a piece of Buttery O on the right corner.
    - Top it off with an orange L as overhang. 
    - Complete the butter box with your other I piece.
    - Finishing off the DPC: 
        - LOJ box on the 3x4 area
        - I piece on 4 height end
        - Use SZT to build a 2 thicc corner.


### OSZ Ball DPC (Extra T DPC)
Pay attention to the order of the SZO
- If SZ comes first, stack them vertically.
- If O comes first, check if S or Z comes first, if S comes first, then use the O to create an S groove (hole) at the bottom
    - Then you can Z-spin, + S-spin + Perfect clear!
- If SOZ (O sandwiched between SZ).. 
    - put your S flat on the ground first.
