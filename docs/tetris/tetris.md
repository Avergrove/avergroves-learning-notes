# Non-Guideline Tetris (TETR.IO)

- These are notes I've started compiling while learning to play Modern Tetris. I am by no-means an expert player, but logging down every step helps! 
- This writing will focus on non-guideline tetris, primarily on TETR.IO since that is the tetris style game that I've been playing.
