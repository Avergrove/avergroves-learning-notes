# (WIP) Non-Guideline Tetris (TETR.IO)

- These are notes I've started compiling while learning to play Modern Tetris. I am by no-means an expert player, but logging down every step helps! 
- This writing will focus on non-guideline tetris, primarily on TETR.IO since that is the tetris style game that I've been playing.
    - Feel free to play Zenith Tower (QP2) anytime! Each milestone helps keep track of player progress! It's also casual so you can bail anytime, really.

## Overview
If you aren't sure where to start, try learning new skills in this order.

### Beginner sets
These are skills that should be worked on first. Separate by milestone goals.

### Level 1: 40 line sprint in 2:30
- Keybinds: I use a scheme of WASD + IJKL (Left/right + Hard drop / Soft drop   \<--\> Rotate CCW / CW + Hold / 180 degree rotation).
- The 40 line sprint: Try and aim for a time of 2:30 if you can. To achieve that, learn the following:
    - Flat stacking: I know it's easier for me to say this but... yes, it literally just means keep the field flat. Flat fields can accomodate more types of pieces.
    - Finesse: This is how efficient you move to each position / orientation with least key presses. This should be learned early before muscle memory kicks in.
        - Correct rotation
        - Move to position with least key presses
    - 9-0 Stacking: This basically means leaving the tetris hole on the right. 
        - Why right over left? Because the pieces spawn biassed to the right. I never confirmed this but if they say so, it... probably is so.
- I'm making these times very lenient, because I want you to be interested in learning all the extra stuff! Speed will always come naturally, so don't stress about it.

#### In the meantime..
- Continue working on your 40 line sprint, in the meantime, you can read up and try out..
    - T-spin doubles (TSDs): learn to make basic t-spins when you see them, you don't have to force them yet.
        - But honestly, just go fuck around and try and force some TSDs! The best way to learn is to make mistakes!
- (Non-guideline Tetris) Read and learn about DAS and ARR, and SDF. Try playing with them if you'd like.
    - DAS is basically how long you have to hold a key before your piece scrolls by itself. Think of the time you hold a button like "A" down before it starts spamming "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA".
    - ARR is how fast your piece automatically scrolls. Most fast tet


## Level 2: 40 line sprint in 2:00
- Continue working on flat stacking and finesse! Don't stress about stacking slowly if it means stacking flat with finesse!
- In addition, you can try finishing 40 line with the following ruleset:
    - Complete 40 line only using Tetrisses (Quads)
    - No hold allowed. 
    - No hold allowed AND no Tetris
- With just flat stacking without holes, you should be able to get to Zenith tower L3 (Disclaimer: I never tested this. But)


#### In the meantime..
- Start learning about donations!
    - Donation is a technique where you temporarily cover up the well to perform a hard line clear (TSD / Tetris, usually TSD).
        - 9 0 will heavily rely on donations to be on par with other stacking styles. But it will very much help you early on since it's easier to stack dirtily and still get out of it.
        - It's also an okay way to start building t-shape holes manually from a queue.
        - Not all donation techniques are available on 9-0, you might be able to figure out some "natural" ones, but there are some unique ones that can be used in 9-0 stacking:
            - Yoshihiro SD / Reverse Yoshihiro.
                - You will need to read about T-spin Minis (TSM) for this.
            -Hamburger stacking.
