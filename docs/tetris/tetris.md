# Non-Guideline Tetris (TETR.IO)

- These are notes I've started compiling while learning to play Modern Tetris. I am by no-means an expert player, but logging down every step helps! 
- This writing will focus on non-guideline tetris, primarily on TETR.IO since that is the tetris style game that I've been playing.
    - Feel free to play Zenith Tower (QP2) anytime! Each milestone helps keep track of player progress! It's also casual so you can bail anytime, really.
    - I would also highly recommend touching Zen mode. The undo button lets you experiment with special stacking styles with low penalty.
