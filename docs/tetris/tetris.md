# Non-Guideline Tetris (TETR.IO)

- These are notes I've started compiling while learning to play Modern Tetris. I am by no-means an expert player, but logging down every step helps! 
- This writing will focus on non-guideline tetris, primarily on TETR.IO since that is the tetris style game that I've been playing.

- The two main Tetris clients I use is TETR.IO and Techmino. 
    - TETR.IO since well, the UI is really fantastic! 
    - Techmino since it's available for playing on Android, which means I can just pick it up while I'm on a commmute. It's a fantastic option with plenty of game modes to improve each aspect of your play!
