# TPC
Did you know there is a TPC setup? It's similar to DPC, except it's for 6L PCs and sends a Tetris -> PC

- A common opener for this is Intai Cannon, which is a 100% setup rate opener:

        - you might want to get familliar with four.lol's "simpler" version first before diving into John Beak's.
    - It's a great companion opener to MKO to learn because the same setup is used for double T 2nd PC (one of the possible MKO outcomes).
    - Bag 1 is simple: OSZ on right, I on far left, LJ on center, with medial one being on the T.
    - For bag 2, there's only 2 paths. 
        - ILZ
        - JSZ


## TPC Setups
- No J/L TPC:
    - How to memorize? If you need to sprint, you need legs. So JL TPC needs the Sprint opener.

- No T TPC:
    - Dependency: The correct side is the one where you have to put an O on the JL first
    - NO bonuses because skim is needed (ew)
