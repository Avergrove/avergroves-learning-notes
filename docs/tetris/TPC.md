# TPC
Did you know there is a TPC setup? It's similar to DPC, except it's for 6L PCs and sends a Tetris -> PC

- A common opener to practice this is Intai Cannon, which is a 100% setup rate opener can lead to 6L PC.

## TPC Setups
- No J/L TPC:
    - How to memorize? If you need to sprint, you need legs. So JL TPC needs the Sprint opener.

- No T TPC:
    - Dependency: The correct side is the one where you have to put an O on the JL first
    - NO bonuses because skim is needed (ew)
