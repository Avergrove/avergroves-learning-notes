# Opener catalog
- These are the opener I'm using:

## Early I Opener
### TKI
- Early I opener
- Great for learning 7-2 stacking. Starts with an early TSD for defensive measures if needed.
- (Remember, you don't have to pop that TSD immediately! Just keep building up and staying flat!)
- Flat top TKI is also the traditional choice to transition into LST.
- The end of the opener is a flat shape. So garbage hole access is relatively safe.

## Early LJ Opener
### MKO
- Early LJ opener
- Like TKI except for LJ bags. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3
- It's a bag two TSD, but still incredibly versatile, being able to also transition to 7-2, 6-3, and 5-4 at the same time! 
    - This means you can adjust accordingly to where the garbage is at 30% chance.
- Flat end opener.

## Early O Opener
### SDPC: 
- "Early" O opener. Early is in quotation marks because you can use it whenever SZT doesn't before that..
- The most common usage is SDPC spin. It deals massive damage. But please don't abuse it.
- The end of the opener is a funnel shape. You might get unlucky and get garbage in the sides.

### Early SZT Opener
### Divorced Gassho
- Early SZT opener. Technically it's a 100% opener as long as you put the S/Z on the side first depending on whether L or J comes first.
- Transitions to 6-3. Sends Bag 2 TSD -> Fractal. 
- There's also a DT cannon -> ST cannon continuation if you want to learn it. Though stacking it can be very awkawrd.
- The opener is not very flat.. But it still is a 100% opener. Your opponent likely doesn't have a TSD in bag one too if you both start from an SZT game however.
- Funnel shaped opener end.

## Other openers
- The ones I haven't been using. These are also just for reference.

### Stickspin
- Like SDPC-spin, but not SDPC-spin.
- Sends T-spin Single, Double, Triple, Double
- The (in)famous opener is well known for counterspiking.
    - Due to S2's change of double garbage cancellation in the first 14 piece, the TSD offset for cancelling the first TSS no longer works...
        - Actually, this may need some confirmation, if I cancel double line, does that mean I send 3 lines?

## PCO
- Perfect Clears dont' deal as much damage in S2 in TETR.IO, but, they do serve as a great stepping stone to learning Twist moves!
- They also provide a flat terrain even if you don't get the PC off. So you have fast access to the garbage hole.

### FinT Cannon
- Early SZT opener
- Great for learning Fin T-spins.
