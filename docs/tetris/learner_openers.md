# Opener catalog
- These are the openers I've looked into using:

## Early Defense, Versatile openers
- The main objective of an opener is to help you transition safely to the mid-game, so these are the ones I focus on learning:

### TKI
- Early I opener
- Great for learning 7-2 stacking. Starts with an early TSD for defensive measures if needed.
- (Remember, you don't have to pop that TSD immediately! Just keep building up and staying flat!)

### MKO
- Early LJ opener
- Like TKI except for LJ bags. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3
- It's a bag two TSD, but still incredibly versatile, just like TKI!

### Hachispin
- An early O opener. Starts with a Single to a Triple, the rest is up to you!
- Can transition to either 7-2 or 6-3.
- Serves as a foil to Stickspin, the Single cancels the single, the triple neutralizes and sends a fugly 2 lines to the stickspinner, so they can't end on a quad.

### Beacon
- Filler opener. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3
- Also great for learning Hamburger stacking

## Kill Openers
- Kill openers focus on overwhelming the opponents right from the start of the game, they powerful, but can turn into a crutch if overused, resulting in a weak mid-game.
- Use them if you want to increase your TR, but honestly, you should focus on learning to neutralize these instead of joining them so you can improve!

### SDPC: Extended SDPC and Nakamuraas Voracity
- Extended SDPC: Like SDPC but coupled with hamburger stacking x2
- Nakamuraa's Voracity: Basically a long series of T-spins that get increasingly dangerous

### Stickspin
- Like SDPC, but not SDPC.
- To be honest, (extended) SDPC is kind of more dangerous.
- Sends T-spin Single, Double, Triple, Double

## Extras
These may not be practical in game, but they are nevertheless useful in learning new technique

## PCO
- Perfect Clears dont' deal as much damage in S2 in TETR.IO, but, they do serve as a great stepping stone to learning Twist moves!
- They also provide a flat terrain even if you don't get the PC off!

### FinT Cannon
- Early SZT opener (!)
- Great for learning Fin T-spins, one of the more practical new-T-spins
