# Opener Main
- This page describes opener main tactics

1) Make sure you learn how to follow up with your opener. Last thing you want is to stand still after blasting your opponent, only to end up getting blasted by your own attack..
2) Know when to terminate your opener early! Some techniques like TST and TD and DT attacks take a long time to build and you are vulnerable at that time.
    - A good practice for this is backfire, try and end your opener early in different parts of your opener as the attack returns!
3) If your opponent knows how to revenge your opener, you might actually want to use a more versatile opener than a kill one and play a whittle down game instead.
4) Speed can easily win you rounds if you hone it. Especially for kill openers like Stickspin / SDPC Spin.
