- You must stack the first 2 bags successfully.
- Bag 1: I should come before O.
- Bag 2: You can do the awkward I spin by doing..
    - Soft Drop. 
    - 180
    - 3x CW
    - If you dont care abuot the all spin at the start, feel free to just burn the T piece.

- Bag 3 and onwards: Improvisation
    - Standard phase:
        - This will consume height from the rightmost 2x I piece stack.
        - JZ on left, OL on right, double I on right wall.
        - ST is consumed in all-spinning
        - Remember the heart on both side is interchangeable. but you still want to always use O with L.
    - Refill phase:
        - The O piece is used on the I stack.
        - The S piece will be used in the right heart twice.
        - The T piece will be used for all-spin twice.
    - Dissolution phase:
        - The L and S piece is now used in the all-spin slot.
            - The consumption order is LST, LST.
            - 2xL is consumed in the lower area to form a "box" shape and compelte the solve.
            - 2x ST is repeated twice.
        - The O is placed on right most side now.
        - The LZ is distributed between left and right heart column
    - These phases are always two step. 
    - The ideal ratio is 9x standard phase, 4x Refill phase, 2x Dissolution phase
