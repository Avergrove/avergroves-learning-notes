# PC Tips
It's highly recommended to read the PC Bibble

- I think one of the most important point to notice in the document is column parity.
- "The sum of L/J and vertical T pieces must add up to an even number", which can help you determine whether a T piece needs to be horizontal or vertical.
    - I'm not sure if single line clears affect this.
- When learning minimals, it might help to group solutions together.
    - Lime DPC will probably be your first experience of this.

## Looping
- A PC loop is 14 lines. The more PCs you can squeeze into a loop, the more score you get.
- Most PCs will require mental brainpower.
- Naturally, this means two things:
    - 14L to one PC is straightforward, but you score less.
    - 7x consective PCs score the most. But you will be living in hell.
    - So most people go for a balance among the two, usually opting TD openers the finish as 8L PC openers, getting 2 PCs.
    - The alternative is Jigsaw, it can potentially get 3 PCs in a loop!
    - The final form is 7x consecutive PC. It's painful but.. you can do it.
