# LST Stacking
LST Stacking deserves its own little section because it's incredible versatile and SHOULD be used with center wells! But it's primarily a 7-2 thing since it gives you more stacking leeway!

I'm trying to write tips beyond "stack flat" here, but I'll still put them here so we have a neat little list, please take note of these in point-by-point!
I am also by means an LST expert (I haven't done a 20TSD successfully yet), the entire point of this document here is to showcase what I observed from trying to stack it.
These are points are primarily aimed towards VS. If you want to spam TSD, Mech TSD might be a good bet since it's pattern stacking and is therefore faster by default.

# Core Rule
``` If at any point your stack is starting to look very sussy, abort LST immediately and revert back to 7-2 stacking```
- Sussy can mean many things, but it's usually one of the following:
    - You wasted a T in the 7-stack
        - This will make stacking a lot more difficult. Alleviate this by spending another T in the stack.
    - You are choked with a dependency drought.
        - Stabilise your stack first!

# Extra tips
0. Before you learn to run, you must walk! If you can't LST stack, then just do a "normal" stack. As an exercise, try doing a 40L sprint with only quads and TSDs. It will give you a general idea on how to manipulate the jag side and control height.
    - I would even encourage starting with an opener: In particular TKI or any that can versatilly transtion to 7-2. (Hachispin, MKO, Hitosura TSD (HTSD) / Hyperspin). Try and hit the ground running!
    - Alternatively, try and hit B2B x20 in Zen!
1. First usual point: Keep your 7 side flat. And keep the height difference around the chasm near zero, these are the most important points, I will keep saying this.
2. Do not compromise your stack for a TSD. LST is strong consistent pressure, but it's not worth crapping on your stack for it. Build up if you need.
2. For each TSD performed, you have an 8 tile residue. This means you will always be able to perform a TSD with each bag.
    - However, the stack will keep growing in size, so you need to use a few I-pieces to Quad.
3. Natural TSDs don't affect parity. As long as you don't place a T piece on the 7-side, you will be able to keep going!
    - If you DO put a T piece on the 7side however, you really want to fix it as soon as possible, while fixing the inevitable height difference.
4. Make sure you know how to manipulate the 2-side! There are 3 configurations:
    - Jag in (Side that closer to the wall is higher)
        - Typically you would put an S/Z on this. This will result in a Flat configuration.
    - Flat (Both tiles are equal height)
        - You can use an L/J to return to jag-in
        - You can also use S/Z again (ST Stacking). This will increase the height difference.
    - Jag out (Side that is further away from wall is higher)
        - You typically don't want this. This usually happens when you use the incorrect S/Z piece as overhang during flat.
        - This also happens on first iteration of ST stacking from flat configuration.
5. Most importantly, don't try to force a TSD if your LST is terminated due to bad parity or height difference. RESOLVE THEM FIRST, I don't want to see any shenanigans until it's resolved.
    - This will happen less the more you practice it.
    - Seriously, resolve your parity before any shenanigans, creating cheese for yourself and free backfire from your enemy is not poggers. It's not a wasted T piece.
7. Recovering from Jag out into Jag in / Flat configuation:
    - Method 1: Easiest way, use a T-piece on the 2-stack to flip Jag-out back into Jag-in. 
    - Method 2: Use an L/J piece to convert back into flat configuration.
    - Method 3: Continue ST stacking. 
        - You can then use L/J for 2 height hole to recover to flat
        - You can then use I   for 3 height hole to recover to Jag in.
8. Although jag configuration can help you recover into LST, none of this matters if the height difference between the 2-side and 7-side is different. RESOLVE THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE FIRST.
9. For the 7-side, pay particular attention to the O piece. Make sure you leave space for the O piece. It's likely that you can use the L/J and S/Z on the Lst side anyway.
11. If you can't find a solution, just terminate it, remember you're playing VS, not Blitz. LST is a pressure tactic. Downstacking and send timing is still incredibly important.
10. Complimentary tactics:
    - The LJ phase of the stacking can be STMB Caved, and nothing is stopping you from doing donations (IF you can keep your stack clean, of course.)
    - If you have excess Ts coming too early, you can consider using Purple Rain to return to a jag-in configuration.
    - LT stacking is entirely valid, too! The heart column on the 7-side is stacked identically to ST stacking. But you will be using S in it this time.
    - If you have an LJ/SZ desync, you can go for an LJ spin an SZ spin.
11. If you can't find an immediate solution, you can build heart shapes of varying heights between gaps. Any even number is good and allows you to LST stack (2, 4, 6, 8). But odd numbers will likely terminate LST! 
    - Even putting a vertical L/J will leave a closed hole behind... So avoid 3-height gap distance at all cost!
