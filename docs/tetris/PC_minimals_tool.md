# PC Minimals Tool
Credits: Thanks PC Gang Discord!

This page was driven by the fact that there isn't minimals yet on MS2's 2C and 2E's 14L PC. It's good practice to learn how to find minimals

There's a bot on the PC Gang discord should help keep finding solutions linear.
(Actually, is this a page a good idea? I feel like everyone might spam that bot page... but then it IS bot page.. but still ajklsjdnl;N;LFNASD;LNA)

For this tutorial, let's use the following fumen structure as reference: 
    - Setup 2e 14L PC: v115@wgD8HeB8FeF8CeH8BeH8BeD8JeAgH
    - Setup 2c 14L PC: 

What are the general steps to finding minimals?
    1. Generate the fumen.
    2. Feed it to the bot.
    3. Link generated.

## Generating the fumen
Use the following URLs:
    - (Original) Japanese: https://fumen.zui.jp/
    - (Translated) English: http://eunich.cochems.com/~zaphod/fumen-eng/
- Without going into the nitty gritty details:
    - Just click on the board to add a tile. Draw the structure you'd like to find a PC for
    - Click "â˜… Data output", this will generate the fumen code.
    - Copy the fumen code near the bottom left.
