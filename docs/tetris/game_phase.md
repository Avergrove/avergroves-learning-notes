# Game Phase
- This page describes what's a "good" action to take in each scenario. 
- WIP: Maybe make a table? Would a table for this be clean?

# First priority, Don't die.
This is obvious, if you die, you lose! It sounds straightforward, but... there's a lot of secondary objectives that aren't made immediately obvious by this

##  Opener phase
The game is in an orderly state. Opener phase ends when we deviate from the specific pattern (Openers). The opener phase dictates what type of midgame you will be playing and will be up against.

You should observe what is your opponent's preferred strategy and try to counter accordingly.

- (Kill) Opener mains
    - Likely the most common you will come across. If you can get a free win, why not take it?
    - The most common kill openers you will find are SDPC Spin and Stickspin.
        - For stickspin, you want to cancel the first TSS with a TSD (Use a 1-bag TSD like TKI for this!)
            - The cancelling is pretty good, but what is even more important is that this sends 2 lines. 
            - 2 lines sound like a very small amount, but that's not the point, the point is that they have to remove their B2B to clear it upstack!
            - Once those TSS is offset-ted, feel free to send any garbage back!
        - SDPC Spin: This opener sends a Single > Double > Triple > Double OR Single > B2B break. So it's incredibly deadly!
            - However, they won't be able to downstack during build up of the triple. So the ideal counter pattern is..
                - Offset the Single
                - Accept the Double.
                    - Blast away at your opponent. Downstack quickly
                - Accept the Triple. Blast away using the accepted triple.
                - They won't be able to downstack. Accept the Double / Single again.
            - So realistically, you only have to offset the single, then use their garbage against them. Just keep the garbage well open! Opener mains execute their actions quickly so you need to be on your toes.

- Low stack players
    - These player do not stack up *at-all*. They will stay at the bottom and skim at the bottom. In a sense it's the opposite of an opener main.
    - Their preferred playstyle is to wait for clean garbage to send it right back to you.
        - Which is why you don't send clean garbage. Send cheese and finally send some clean (but keep some in your reserve as emergency)

- Mechanical patterns
    - More known as Mech TSD. It's a bit tricky to learn to counter it at first, but it's very mechanical, so you also have a mechanical way of winning it.
    - As long you stay at the bottom, your opponent is slowly digging their own grave by making worse and worse I dependencies, you don't even really need to send back to them.
        - Just make sure to save the I piece.

- Raw APM
    - 

## Mid Game
Mid game is chaotic. I've listed this in-point, you don't have to work on all of them at once, but try and focus on each one at a time.

### General tips
- The most likely way to kill your opponent is to do a combo downstack to a quad. Look up funnelstacking
- Timing is incredibly important! It's essentially the "implicit" knowledge needed to improve your rank outside of increasing APM, much like the concept of efficiency and map coverage in MOBAs.
- To show how monumentally important timing is, let's see what happens if you time badly..
    - Scenario: 
        - You are at the top of the board, your opponent is at the bottom.
        - Your opponent doesn't really have anymore ammo to take you out after spiking, so they will need time to build up, maybe like 7 seconds.
        - Bad Action: Because you are the top of the board, you scramble and panic to open the garbage well, trying to decrease in height as much as possible while possibly wrecking your board.
            - You've opened the garbage hole! But now your board is in a terrible state...
            - Meanwhile, your opponent is super slow, they placed like, what, 4 pieces? 
                - and then they'll be like.. oh, free garbage, okay, I'll send it back. 
            - So now you are back to your original state... except worse, because now you've also wrecked your board state just to decrease in height that short while.
            - Your opponent, on the other hand, did not receive any pressure at all! Now they just continue working those 4 pieces they've placed and... quad! You're dead.
            - The lesson here is, don't send willy nilly, you're literally accelerating your death.
        - Good action: Take your time, you are not in any danger until your opponent builds a quad. In the meantime, let's try and set up more defense and ammo!
            - Your opponent is unlikely to get spiked to death since they are at the bottom of the board. 
            - However, they can take their time to wait out for your death..
            - The solution is to try and have a defense plan ready as you downstack.
            - If you are forced to send garbage, make sure to have a TSD, or maybe another quad ready as they will inevitably send it back.
            - If your opponent decides to send you garbage, that's "good"! Your attacks can now be used to defend instead of backfiring on yourself, hopefully buying more time to live to fight another day!
