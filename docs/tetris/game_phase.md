# Game Phase
- This page describes what's a "good" action to take in each scenario. 
- WIP: Maybe make a table? Would a table for this be clean?

# First priority, Don't die.
This is obvious, if you die, you lose! It sounds straightforward, but... there's a lot of secondary objectives that aren't made immediately obvious by this

##  Opener phase
The game is in an orderly state. Opener phase ends when we deviate from the specific pattern (Openers). The opener phase dictates what type of midgame you will be playing and will be up against.

You should observe what is your opponent's preferred strategy and try to counter accordingly.

- (Kill) Opener mains
    - Likely the most common you will come across. If you can get a free win, why not take it?
    - The most common kill openers you will find are SDPC Spin and Stickspin.
        - For stickspin, you want to cancel the first TSS with a TSD (Use a 1-bag TSD like TKI for this!)
            - The cancelling is pretty good, but what is even more important is that this sends 2 lines. 
            - 2 lines sound like a very small amount, but that's not the point, the point is that they have to remove their B2B to clear it upstack!
            - Once those TSS is offset-ted, feel free to send any garbage back!
        - SDPC Spin: This opener sends a Single > Double > Triple > Double OR Single > B2B break. So it's incredibly deadly!
            - However, they won't be able to downstack during build up of the triple. So the ideal counter pattern is..
                - Offset the Single
                - Accept the Double.
                    - Blast away at your opponent. Downstack quickly
                - Accept the Triple. Blast away using the accepted triple.
                - They won't be able to downstack. Accept the Double / Single again.
            - So realistically, you only have to offset the single, then use their garbage against them. Just keep the garbage well open! Opener mains execute their actions quickly so you need to be on your toes.

- Low stack players
    - These player do not stack up *at-all*. They will stay at the bottom and skim at the bottom. In a sense it's the opposite of an opener main.
    - Their preferred playstyle is to wait for clean garbage to send it right back to you.
        - Which is why you don't send clean garbage. Send cheese and finally send some clean (but keep some in your reserve as emergency)

- Mechanical patterns
    - More known as Mech TSD. It's a bit tricky to learn to counter it at first, but it's very mechanical, so you also have a mechanical way of winning it.
    - There's no need to cancel the garbage as long as you are at the bottom. As long as you don't waste an I piece, you should ample amount of ammo to send it all back.

- Raw APM

## Mid Game
Mid game is chaotic. I've listed this in-point, you don't have to work on all of them at once, but try and focus on each one at a time.

### General tips


- The most likely way to kill your opponent is to do a combo downstack to a quad. Look up funnelstacking
- Don't send clean if your opponent is at the bottom of the board. This only accelerates your defeat.
    - To show how



- Opponent's board is clean
    - There is mostly zero reason to try to spike 

During Midgame, we should split 

in a theoretical scenario, you cant win a game by defending
Fortunately, this is tetris. The problem is, if you defend, you are relying on your opponent's mismove to win, we *need* to learn to attack

- Let's split the scenario into two, you and opponent
    - Low, both neutral
    - Low, clean
    - High, pressured

- Neutral midgame
    - Both players are at a neutral scenario.
    - Because both players are at a neutral position, they will likely gravitate to their natural playstyle.
    - Just pressure your enemy until there is an imbalance!
