# FAQ
- This section is dedicated to answering questions you ask yourself. It's mostly a miscellaneous, commonly asked topic.

- How do I counter enemy openers?
    - Use your own opener

- The enemy opener is too fast!
    - If you can't go fast, then try going slow. Build flat for equal garbage access change, and defend. One TSD / Quad is usually enough.
    - Or at least save use your slowness to defend using things like TKI... unless your opponent is intentionally slowing down too.

- I'm always put on cheese duty, I can't attack like this! What was the point of practicing 6-3?!
    - If you want to stay in good position, you NEED to defend. It's crucial, seriously. Defend properly while pressuring.

- I can't sprint faster
    It's likely one of the following issues:
    - 1: Beginner: Not practicing finesse and flat stacking.
    - 2: 6-3: Dependency avoidance, T piece parity.
    - 3: ***Not looking ahead***
        - Probably the most important, placing the piece you have fast doesn't mean you are stacking fast if you stutter on the next one.
        - It's better to place in a consistent rhythm and speed it up over time.
        - If you are learning music, this will also apply to sight reading! So you might as well also learn it here now and refine the skill.

- I'm hardstuck on \<?\> rank
    - You should probably watch your replays.
    - No, really. You are probably saying "pffft, I already know my mistakes from when I play", and all right, that's fine, but if you lose and don't know why, try and look at the replays, both you and your opponent's board. Mid game losses are usually related to macro-strategy.
