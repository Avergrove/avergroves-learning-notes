# FAQ
- This section is dedicated to answering questions you ask yourself. It's mostly a miscellaneous, commonly asked topic.

- How do I counter enemy openers?
    - If your opponent is using a kill opener, your first thought may be to downstack immediately... this isn't always a good idea.
        - If you try to downstack immediately, you may fail to do so and simply tank more garbage and inevitably die, especially if you get a column 2 / 9 garbage!
        - Instead, try to defend a few attacks with your own opener, and look for the perfect opportunity to combo downstack into your garbage!

- I'm always put on cheese duty, I can't attack like this! What was the point of practicing 6-3?!
    - If you want to stay in good position, you NEED to defend. It's crucial, seriously. Defend properly while pressuring.
    - Cheese attacks are inherently ineffecient. So you will be in good position if you defend against them.
        - If they stop sending, they have to start the combo over.
        - If they keep sending, they are cancelling inefficiently.
    - If your opponent is not using a C4W setup, you probably don't need to stress about the amount of cheese you receive. You *should* stress about the possible combo quad from it, though.

- I can't sprint faster
    It's likely one of the following issues:
    - 1: Beginner: Not practicing finesse and flat stacking.
    - 2: 6-3: Dependency avoidance, T piece parity.
    - 3: ***Not looking ahead***
        - Probably the most important, placing the piece you have fast doesn't mean you are stacking fast if you stutter on the next one.
        - It's better to place in a consistent rhythm and speed it up over time.
        - If you are learning music, this will also apply to sight reading! So you might as well also learn it here now and refine the skill.

- Handling 4 wide
    - Try and let your opponent start a combo first. Then only send.
    - Here comes the important part: Don't stop. Keep attacking! Each bag that you fail to attack with will result in cheese!
    - Basically, the only solution to 4wide is to apm well during the 4wide combo time window.
