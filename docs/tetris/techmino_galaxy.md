# Techmino Galaxy
Techmino Galaxy is the sequel to Techmino! It's currently under development.. as the github readme mentions, please avoid discussing about it outside of the techmino community.

## Installation
### Windows
1) Recursive clone the techmino galaxy repository. Recursive is needed because Zenitha is another repo from 26F, which is in the same repo.
2) Download Love2d.
3) You can technically launch Techmino Galaxy by drag and dropping the Techmino Galaxy folder onto the Love 2d executable (in program files), however, you will notice that there are fmod errors and there won't be sound.
4) Sound files:
    - Save data folder refers to user / roaming, example: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Techmino_Galaxy\soundbank
