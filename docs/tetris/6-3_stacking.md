# 6-3 Stacking
The "Standard" in T-spinning efficiency.

Typically the second stacking style learned after 9-0, for two reasons:
- Sprinting: Less KPP is needed to stack up quickly and knock em down quickly.
- VS: Modular T-spin pattern stacking on the 3-side helps ensure your piceces are in good balance.

- For sprinting, just watch orz's video on 6-3 stacking, it should be enough to get you started!

- For VS, the main thing that helped me click was ensuring that whenever you are building a TSD overhang on the 3 side, make ALWAYS sure you are ready to convert it into a neat heart shape. Leaving only a single S or L leaves the dependency on for longer and not reading the queue from that usually spells death for your back to back.
    - Hearts are 3x3 boxes with a hole on one one of the corner tiles. They're called hearts because if you rotate it around they look like hearts.
    - They're also called saw tooths because if you stack them sideways, they start looking like a sawtooth wave.
    - Stacking hearts is also a fundamental technique of ST stacking. So after comfortably learning to comfortably stack 6-3 with minimal waste, go ahead and look into ST stacking.
        - Also, please take note using Ts to fix parity is not really "waste". The alternative is crapping on your stack for a single TSD that your opponent will probably use against you anyway. Don't crap on your stack unless you are sure you can win the game with it.
