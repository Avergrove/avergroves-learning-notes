# Opener catalog
- This page describes the opener I use
- For TKI and MKO, I would highly recommend learning their PC routes! As a beginner it's likely you can't sustain LST stacking for long, so having PC as alternatives to clear garbage against SDPC and Stickspin is really strong!
- TODO: Add links to practice PC patterns for each of these openers.

## Early I Opener
### TKI
- Early I opener
- Great for learning 7-2 stacking. Starts with an early TSD for defensive measures if needed.
- (Remember, you don't have to pop that TSD immediately! Just keep building up and staying flat!)
- Flat top TKI is also the traditional choice to transition into LST.
    - The end of the opener is a flat shape. So garbage hole access is relatively safe.
    - Perfect clears:
        - To go for this route, you need either early JL or IO. Otherwise, just LST stack.
        - DD Parfait and Yack PC complement each other. They both use early IO with I hugging the wall. The JL sequence covers both of them.
            - You can actually see if DD Parfait will work, if not, try Yack PC!
        - DD Parfait is the simplest: You don't have to solve, you are gambling that your next piece is a perfect clear
        - Yack PC (8L PC): early OI, put I next to the wall. 
            - Solving without an early T is straightforward.
            - Solving WITH a T requires skimming. Try skimming with either the L or T piece.
        - You can probably ignore 8L PC since that's covered by DD Parfait and Yack PC, so that leaves 12L PC.
        - 12L PC: You need early JL instead in second bag. Put JL, then put the OI in the same configuration as Yack PC above.
            - This won't always work, but it IS a pattern stack, so..
            - Anyway, the basic idea is to stack LST normally... 
            - After TSD: Build a pointy OSZ for the TSD notch, then use I and J to separate again. Use L to pretend you are continuing to LST stack. Surprisingly, the OSZ is interchangeable despite not being a ball.
                - You should try to place everything else first before the OSZ ball since that's the only thing that changes.
            - After TSD 2: The SZ position is fixed in the usualy spot for LST stacking. Fill in the rest. The O piece should ideally come early to avoid B2B break.
            - After TSD 3: Let's go gambling!

    - There's also a 12L PC solution for early JL in second bag.. maybe I can die less with TKI now..
- Fonzie TKI: 
    - I like freestyling this my way! I put an OSZ ball in the 2-gap, and JL to form a TSD hole, you can dump the I piece by the JL side.
- I didn't study the other 2 types of TKI..
- As much as I hate to admit it, I also die the most with TKI so...
    - Anyway, it's still good LST practice haha.

## Early LJ Opener
### MKO
- Early LJ opener
- Like TKI except for LJ bags. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3
- It's a bag two TSD, but still incredibly versatile, being able to also transition to 7-2, 6-3, and 5-4 at the same time! 
    - This means you can adjust accordingly to where the garbage is at 30% chance.
- Flat end opener.
- You should learn the 4L PCs! Usually if a bag is annoying to stack, you can get a 4L PC! It's likely you won't get the PC damage off, but it does keep your well clean!
    - 4L PC Follow ups:
        - IL(SZ)
- There's also a 8L PC! More information on four.lol. These solutiosn are non-straightforward, so learn it in your spare time.


## Early O Opener
### Hachispin
- Early O opener
- Sends a TSS -> TST. What you want to do afterwards is up to you!
    - Continuation: TSD. This lets you pick either 7-2, 6-3, or 5-4. You can use it to build around a garbage hole!
    - Continuation: PC. If you get an early TS / TL, you can do an 8L PC! Surprisingly enough, you will likely be able to pull the PC off because your opponent is likely using SDPC spin.
        - The respective DPC continuations for this is I / SZ DPC.
            - Lime DPC is painful to solve, you can look into the alternative PC solution, it doesn't yield a TSD, but it does still give a PC! Search up the Jigsaw PC loop for more information.
- Hachispin is also great because you can set up prophecy burst damage! You can tank up acceptable damage in the meantime and then send it all back, and try to quickly clear up the garbage well for a Quad to murder someone.

### Early SZT Opener
### Divorced Gassho (keymo)
- Early SZT opener. Technically it's a 100% opener as long as you put the S/Z on the side first depending on whether L or J comes first.
- Extra DT setup reference: https://w.atwiki.jp/sioyakitetrisopener/pages/380.html
- Transitions to 6-3. Sends Bag 2 TSD -> Fractal. 
- There's also a DT cannon -> ST cannon continuation if you want to learn it. Though stacking it can be very awkawrd.
- The opener is not very flat.. But it still is a 100% opener. Your opponent likely doesn't have a TSD in bag one too if you both start from an SZT game however.
- Funnel shaped opener end.
- Although the 4L PC chance is low, it makes the 2nd PC worth learning precisely because there's only one set of possible piece to PC!
    - See the document for how the 4L PC looks like.
    - J + S + T will be consumed, so your 2nd PC combination will be L + I + Z + O (omg lizards i love lizards)
        - This is IOLZ on four.lol.
        - Quick link: https://four.lol/perfect-clears/2nd#4-8806
            - Looks kind of like a farm tractor, honestly.

## Other openers
- The ones I haven't been using. These are also just for reference.

### Stickspin
- Like SDPC-spin, but not SDPC-spin.
- Sends T-spin Single, Double, Triple, Double
- The (in)famous opener is well known for counterspiking.
    - Due to S2's change of double garbage cancellation in the first 14 piece, the TSD offset for cancelling the first TSS no longer works...
        - Actually, this may need some confirmation, if I cancel double line, does that mean I send 3 lines?

## PCO
- Perfect Clears dont' deal as much damage in S2 in TETR.IO, but, they do serve as a great stepping stone to learning Twist moves!
- They also provide a flat terrain even if you don't get the PC off. So you have fast access to the garbage hole.

### FinT Cannon
- Early SZT opener
- Great for learning Fin T-spins.

### SDPC: 
- "Early" O opener. Early is in quotation marks because you can use it whenever SZT doesn't before that..
- The most common usage is SDPC spin. It deals massive damage. But please don't abuse it.
- The end of the opener is a funnel shape. You might get unlucky and get garbage in the sides.
