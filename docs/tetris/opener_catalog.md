# Opener catalog
- This page describes the opener I use.. or used.
- I learn two sets of openers: memorized and freestyle ones.
- Memorized openers send much attack from the start, but freestyle ones are usually flat and have plenty of options (offense vs downstacking as needed)

## Early I Opener
### TKI
- ![TKI Opener](/img/tetris/openers/tki.png)
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/TKI_3_Opening#Flat_Top_variation
- Early I freestyle opener
- Great for learning 7-2 stacking. Starts with an early TSD for defensive measures if needed.
    - Remember, you don't have to pop that TSD immediately! If you have a follow up in mind, just build those first. As always, you don't want to send free cleans..
- Flat top TKI is also the traditional choice to transition into LST.
- Because flat top TKI is so easily constructed, it might backfire on you if don't have any follow ups... (you just sent 4 free clean lines to your opponent, now you will get SDPCspinned to death)
    - It's *highly* recommended you learn the follow ups that will yield at least 3x tsd so you can continue defending as needed.
    - These three followups are the ones I use to extend the base value of the opener:
        - 12L PC (OI Base at opposite end of LST stack): It's 4 TSDs in total + a potential PC, what's not to like?
        - 6L + 8L PC (DD Parfait / Yack PC - JL Base at opposite end of LST stack): The PC solve is simple. Also a PC will help clean up your board so you can downstack as needed.
            - You can look ahead at the queue for DD Parfait. If it doesn't work, go for Yack PC.
            - If you still can't PC, the board is still quite clean and has obvious options for LST Stacking. Basically 2/3 TSDs in total.
    - Otherwise, just LST stack (normally). Practice squeezing 2x more TSDs if you can! If you don't see any other way forward, just start downstacking.
        - You will be surprised how high one side of your stack will grow when you don't have options. If a garbage appears at that side then well... you're cooked.

### Reliable TSD
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/Reliable_TSD
- Early I memorization opener
- It's 3 TSDs! What's not to like?

## Early LJ Opener
### MKO
- ![MKO Opener](/img/tetris/openers/mko.png)
- youknowthecopypasta
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/MKO_Stacking
- Early LJ freestyle opener
- Like TKI except for LJ bags. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3 (Though you always have the option to go into 5-4 or 7-2, it's more natural to go into 6-3)
- It's recommended that you learn these 3 scenarios at least when using MKO:
    - 4L PC: They are "easy" to spot! Just go for it when you see it! You always need an O piece.
    - Waste T: Most tutorials recommend going for air TSDs, but for me, I just go for quads because I'm not that good yet. The next T piece has a habit of coming fairly late, so you might be able to build a TST set up in the meantime without wasting a T piece.
        - Of course, the start of the match has the most garbage.. so be careful!
    - Incomplete TST: If you didn't waste T and decide to go for a 6-3 stacking style, there's a very likely chance you will see this scenario, you can find it on four.lol
- Extras:
    - 6L PC: 100% chance of PC if you practice enough!
        - take note there's no solution if J comes as the fourth piece, you must use the piece after the J.
        - You can practice it <a href="https://himitsuconfidential.github.io/downstack-practice/usermode.html/______XXXX_____XXXXXX___XXXXXXXX__XXXXXX=[SOT]!,[ITOSZL]">here!</a>
    - 8L PC: It's "only" 88.33% chance, you will probably mess up your board if you fail.. nothing is stopping you from learning it, though.

## Early O Opener
### SDPC:
- ![SDPC Opener](/img/tetris/openers/sdpc.png)
- "Early" O opener. 
    - Early is in quotation marks because you can use it whenever SZT doesn't come before O..
- The most common usage is SDPC spin. It deals massive damage. But please don't abuse it.
- The other use is the original SDPC. It's less of a crutch and frankly pretty badass whenever you get an all clear with it. The all clear is also very defensive, as compared to SDPC spin because you get a clean, flat field.
- The JL in bag 1 is interchangeable! See: Kezdabez' video
        - The respective DPC continuations for this is I / SZ DPC.

## Early SZT Opener 

## 100% Build cover Openers (TD Openers)
### MS2 (Mountainous Stacking 2)
- ![MS2 Opener](/img/tetris/openers/ms2.png)
- 100% Build cover (if mirrored)
- To determine the correct direction, pay attention to the first L/J that arrives.
- Go to Harddrop, and look at Cover C (Stray Cannon) / Cover E (Compromise)
- ... Then learn the rest!

### Kisaragi Stacking
- John Beak: https://tetris.johnbeak.cz/8l/kisaragi.php
- Want a no-nonsense 100% build cover TD -> PC opener? Well, here you go!
- The correct direction can be determined by the first L/J  that arrives.
- You only need one stacking method, heart solution, and dpc!
    - You can optimize it by adding in the honey cup setup. (I < L)

### Dubble
- Dubble 1, not new Dubble. 
- It sends ...a single line. but a single line is the difference between the enemy PCing or using your garbage against you.
- Even if you get hit by garbage early, you still have an I piece. And there's plenty of empty space on the field so it's quite likely you will get a clean well.
- It's honestly surprisingly reasonable if you're slower at an opener.


## Other openers
- The ones I haven't been using or don't use anymore. These are also just for reference.

### Stickspin
- Like SDPC-spin, but not SDPC-spin.
- Sends T-spin Single, Double, Triple, Double
- The (in)famous opener is well known for counterspiking.
    - Due to S2's change of double garbage cancellation in the first 14 piece, this opener is actually *buffed* your TSS can now offset an opponent TKI's TSD...
    - SDPC Spin is generally accepted to be better (I'm not sure why, though.)

## PCO
- Perfect Clears dont' deal as much damage in S2 in TETR.IO, but, they do serve as a great stepping stone to learning Twist moves!
- They also provide a flat terrain even if you don't get the PC off. So you have fast access to the garbage hole.

### FinT Cannon
- Early SZT opener
- Great for learning Fin T-spins.

### Divorced Gassho (keymo)
- Why I stopped using this: I wanted a more streamlined, "symmetrical" build that doesn't build extremely high. 
    - If you only start building the DT on bag 4, you're probably going to get blasted by other TD openers.
- Early SZT opener. Technically it's a 100% opener as long as you put the S/Z on the side first depending on whether L or J comes first.
- Extra DT setup reference: https://w.atwiki.jp/sioyakitetrisopener/pages/380.html
- Transitions to 6-3. Sends Bag 2 TSD -> Fractal. 
- There's also a DT cannon -> ST cannon continuation if you want to learn it. Though stacking it can be very awkawrd.
- The opener is not very flat.. But it still is a 100% opener. Your opponent likely doesn't have a TSD in bag one too if you both start from an SZT game however.
- Funnel shaped opener end.
- Although the 4L PC chance is low, it makes the 2nd PC worth learning precisely because there's only one set of possible piece to PC!
    - See the document for how the 4L PC looks like.
    - J + S + T will be consumed, so your 2nd PC combination will be L + I + Z + O (omg lizards i love lizards)
        - This is IOLZ on four.lol.
        - Quick link: https://four.lol/perfect-clears/2nd#4-8806
            - Looks kind of like a farm tractor, honestly.

### Hitosura TSD (HTSD) / Hyperspin
- Replaced with Gassho TSD simply due to the fact that it's also a 3x tsd build... except it can also do perfect clears.
- Uses a T as the base of the opener.
- Sends a TSD. You can then either transtion to ....
    - an Imperial cross + 9/0 stacking
    - or continue 7-2 stacking. 
- Frankly it has low firepower and takes a while to build.


### Gassho TSD
- Why I stopped using this: Follow up is non-obvious if you can't PC. In reality this is a one-TSD opener.
- Resource 1 (JP): https://shiwehi.com/tetris/template/gasshotsd.php
- Resource 2 (CN): http://tetriswiki.cn/p/%E5%90%88%E6%8E%8C_TSD_PC
- Not to be confused with Keymo opener (Divorced Gassho), which I did
- Apparently this is one of the few openers that allow you to get a 4L PC after a TSD.
- Sends 1 TSD, plus one of the following continuations
    - Continuation 1: 4L PC
        - Just need a TJL queue! The solution is extremely obvious
            - You can build a TKI afterwards.
            - .. or You can always also build a 2nd PC! 
                - The corresponding 2nd pc is ISZO
    - Continuation 2: 6L Perfect clear
        - If you get an OSZ opening, then this will PC will feel familliar, it's just like MKO!
    - Continuation 3: Donation TSD
    - Continuation 4: STSD
    - Continuation 5: TSD into 6-3 stacking
- If the T comes early in second bag, you get a 100% PC rate!
- If not, you send 4 TSDs in a row. 
    - The flavor of the 2nd to 3rd TSD is up to you! 
        - If early L and J: Donation + remnant, or 
        - If early O: STSD
- Transitions into 5-4.
- Evaluating which mirror to start the build with can take some time.


### Dot Cannon
- Why I stopped using: Go learn MS2. If Hachispin is the weaker counterpart of SDPC spin, then DOT cannon is the weaker counterpart of MS2.
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/Dot_Cannon
- The original page has a bit more documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avJqINBvas15fsPksig_WA6bW_vEsSiKTZ-9uBfVy00/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.19nenz673skk
- 100% build rate opener. (if you mirror!)
    - The correct build direction is determined by the first J/L piece that arrives.
- Builds a TD attack to perfect clear, in fact, most SZT openers try to do this because learning bag 1-TSD SZT openers is hell and requires you to pay attention to what comes other T without hold.
- It's relatively streamlined, so you can learn it quickly if you just want something to use for VS.
    - There's no strict pattern though, I thought an early TSD and an early SZ or ZL is enough but..
- You can also ignore the PC and complete your TD and jump straight to 5-4 / 6-3 Stacking. Which is a lot more practical than it sounds.
- The remaining TSD can also be upgraded into Imperial cross or Trinity (trinity is dangerous as always) at your leisure.
- An easier way to wrap around it is only go for a PC if you have an early TSD so you can eyeball the rest.
    - Hint: The T piece is always for TSd, the O piece always sit at the same position.
- The relevant PCs are Save-S and save-T DPC.

### Dragon bucket
- Why I stopped using it: It has dragon in the name but.. honestly it's better to just go for a 6-3 for a flat stack.
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/Dragonbucket
- Pros: It has dragon in the name. So I'm obliged to learn it.
- Uniquely, it's an SZ opener that doesn't require other early dependencies.
- The bag 2 TST lets it counteract most garbage and send an annoying 3-line to the opponent
- Thanks to all mini you can kind of deviate away from the original bag 3 and slide in the L instead for a b2b stack and a clean field and a TSD slot available.

### Hachispin
- Why I stopped using it: SDPC is superior. 
- Early O "freestyle" opener
- Sends a TSS -> TST. What you want to do afterwards is up to you!
It's recommended for you to get familliar with the residue left behind:
    - Basic TSD: Just slide in a J/L piece. This lets you pick either 7-2, 6-3, or 5-4. 
    - TSS -> TSD: If you have a J/L + S/Z combo
    - PC: If you get an early TS / TL, you can do an 8L PC at 100% success rate!
- Like MKO and TKI, Hachispin leaves a flat field behind so you can quickly abort the opener and downstack as needed.
