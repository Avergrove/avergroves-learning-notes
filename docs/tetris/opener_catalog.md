# Opener catalog
- This page describes the opener I use.. or used.
- For TKI and MKO, I would highly recommend learning their PC routes! As a beginner it's likely you can't sustain LST stacking for long, so having PC as alternatives to clear garbage against SDPC and Stickspin is really strong!
- TODO: Add links to practice PC patterns for each of these openers.

## Early I Opener
### TKI
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/TKI_3_Opening#Flat_Top_variation
- Early I opener
- Great for learning 7-2 stacking. Starts with an early TSD for defensive measures if needed.
    - Remember, you don't have to pop that TSD immediately! If you have a follow up in mind, just build those first. As always, you don't want to send free cleans..
- Flat top TKI is also the traditional choice to transition into LST.
- Because flat top TKI is so easily constructed, it might backfire on you if don't have any follow ups... (you just sent 4 free clean lines to your opponent, now you will get SDPCspinned to death)
    - It's *highly* recommended you learn the follow ups that will yield at least 3x tsd so you can continue defending as needed.
    - These three followups are the ones I use to extend the base value of the opener:
        - 12L PC (OI Base at opposite end of LST stack): It's 4 TSDs in total + a potential PC, what's not to like?
        - 6L + 8L PC (DD Parfait / Yack PC - JL Base at opposite end of LST stack): The PC solve is simple. Also a PC will help clean up your board so you can downstack as needed.
            - You can look ahead at the queue for DD Parfait. If it doesn't work, go for Yack PC.
            - If you still can't PC, the board is still quite clean and has obvious options for LST Stacking. Basically 2/3 TSDs in total.
    - Otherwise, just LST stack (normally). Practice squeezing 2x more TSDs if you can! If you don't see any other way forward, just start downstacking.
        - You will be surprised how high one side of your stack will grow when you don't have options. If a garbage appears at that side then well... you're cooked.

## Early LJ Opener
### MKO
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/MKO_Stacking
- Early LJ opener
- Like TKI except for LJ bags. Transitions seamlessly to 6-3
- It's a bag two TSD, but still incredibly versatile, being able to also transition to 7-2, 6-3, and 5-4 at the same time! 
    - This means you can adjust accordingly to where the garbage is at 30% chance.
- You should learn the 4L PCs. Usually if a bag is annoying to stack, you can get a 4L PC! It's likely you won't get the PC damage off, but it does keep your well clean!
    - MKO also makes a great opportunity to learn 2nd PCs. Uniquely MKO has access to TTSZ 2nd PC boards!
- There's also a 8L PC! It's extra follow methods in following up, so might as well learn it!
- Waste-T path is generally troublesome (for me). What I usually do is go for a T-spin Single and build floating T-spins... however this tends to be risky because your next T isn't coming soon.


## Early O Opener
### Hachispin
- Early O opener
- Your opponent is likely to be using SDPC spin. And honestly, I would partially recommend it haha. Anyway, I'm sticking with Hachispin for now.
- Sends a TSS -> TST. What you want to do afterwards is up to you!
    - Continuation: TSD. This lets you pick either 7-2, 6-3, or 5-4. You can use it to build around a garbage hole!
    - Continuation: PC. If you get an early TS / TL, you can do an 8L PC! Surprisingly enough, you will likely be able to pull the PC off because your opponent is likely using SDPC spin.
        - The respective DPC continuations for this is I / SZ DPC.

## Early SZT Opener
### Dot Cannon
- Hard Drop: https://harddrop.com/wiki/Dot_Cannon
- 100% build rate opener. (if you mirror!)
    - The correct build direction is determined by the first J/L piece that arrives.
- Builds a TD attack to perfect clear, in fact, most SZT openers try to do this because learning bag 1-TSD SZT openers is hell and requires you to pay attention to what comes other T without hold.
- It's relatively streamlined, so you can learn it quickly if you just want something to use for VS.
    - There's no strict pattern though, I thought an early TSD and an early SZ or ZL is enough but..
- You can also ignore the PC and complete your TD and jump straight to 5-4 / 6-3 Stacking. Which is a lot more practical than it sounds.
- The remaining TSD can also be upgraded into Imperial cross or Trinity (trinity is dangerous as always) at your leisure.
- An easier way to wrap around it is only go for a PC if you have an early TSD so you can eyeball the rest.
    - Hint: The T piece is always for TSd, the O piece always sit at the same position.
- The relevant PCs are Save-S and save-T DPC.

## Blitz Opener
### PC Loop
See the following thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Tetris/comments/1g58tg8/what_8l_pc_should_i_learn_for_dpc/

- Basically:
    - Learn SDPC
    - Learn Tsar Cannon + Satsuki
    - I would learn SDPC first since it's usable in VS, too!

- The theoretical PC expert would go for 7x consecutive PC.
    - However, a compromise would be Jigsaw loop.
    - For beginners, there's even a simplified Jigsaw loop!
        - https://torchlight.github.io/tetnotes/simplified-jigsaw.html


### Wabi-sabi mode
- Wabi-sabi = no perfect clears allowed
- Basically use any opener that transitions into 6-3 or 7-2 and stack away!


## Other openers
- The ones I haven't been using or don't use anymore. These are also just for reference.

### Stickspin
- Like SDPC-spin, but not SDPC-spin.
- Sends T-spin Single, Double, Triple, Double
- The (in)famous opener is well known for counterspiking.
    - Due to S2's change of double garbage cancellation in the first 14 piece, this opener is actually *buffed* your TSS can now offset an opponent TKI's TSD...
    - SDPC Spin is generally accepted to be better (I'm not sure why, though.)

## PCO
- Perfect Clears dont' deal as much damage in S2 in TETR.IO, but, they do serve as a great stepping stone to learning Twist moves!
- They also provide a flat terrain even if you don't get the PC off. So you have fast access to the garbage hole.

### FinT Cannon
- Early SZT opener
- Great for learning Fin T-spins.

### SDPC: 
- "Early" O opener. Early is in quotation marks because you can use it whenever SZT doesn't before that..
- The most common usage is SDPC spin / Extended SDPC Spin. It deals massive damage. But please don't abuse it.
- The end of the opener is a funnel shape. You might get lucky and get garbage in the center for MASSIVE damage.

### Divorced Gassho (keymo)
- Why I stopped using this: I wanted a more streamlined, "symmetrical" build that doesn't build extremely high. 
    - If you only start building the DT on bag 4, you're probably going to get blasted by other TD openers.
- Early SZT opener. Technically it's a 100% opener as long as you put the S/Z on the side first depending on whether L or J comes first.
- Extra DT setup reference: https://w.atwiki.jp/sioyakitetrisopener/pages/380.html
- Transitions to 6-3. Sends Bag 2 TSD -> Fractal. 
- There's also a DT cannon -> ST cannon continuation if you want to learn it. Though stacking it can be very awkawrd.
- The opener is not very flat.. But it still is a 100% opener. Your opponent likely doesn't have a TSD in bag one too if you both start from an SZT game however.
- Funnel shaped opener end.
- Although the 4L PC chance is low, it makes the 2nd PC worth learning precisely because there's only one set of possible piece to PC!
    - See the document for how the 4L PC looks like.
    - J + S + T will be consumed, so your 2nd PC combination will be L + I + Z + O (omg lizards i love lizards)
        - This is IOLZ on four.lol.
        - Quick link: https://four.lol/perfect-clears/2nd#4-8806
            - Looks kind of like a farm tractor, honestly.

### Hitosura TSD (HTSD) / Hyperspin
- Replaced with Gassho TSD simply due to the fact that it's also a 3x tsd build... except it can also do perfect clears.
- Uses a T as the base of the opener.
- Sends a TSD. You can then either transtion to ....
    - an Imperial cross + 9/0 stacking
    - or continue 7-2 stacking. 
- Frankly it has low firepower and takes a while to build.


### Gassho TSD
- Why I stopped using this: Follow up is non-obvious if you can't PC. In reality this is a one-TSD opener.
- Resource 1 (JP): https://shiwehi.com/tetris/template/gasshotsd.php
- Resource 2 (CN): http://tetriswiki.cn/p/%E5%90%88%E6%8E%8C_TSD_PC
- Not to be confused with Keymo opener (Divorced Gassho), which I did
- Apparently this is one of the few openers that allow you to get a 4L PC after a TSD.
- Sends 1 TSD, plus one of the following continuations
    - Continuation 1: 4L PC
        - Just need a TJL queue! The solution is extremely obvious
            - You can build a TKI afterwards.
            - .. or You can always also build a 2nd PC! 
                - The corresponding 2nd pc is ISZO
    - Continuation 2: 6L Perfect clear
        - If you get an OSZ opening, then this will PC will feel familliar, it's just like MKO!
    - Continuation 3: Donation TSD
    - Continuation 4: STSD
    - Continuation 5: TSD into 6-3 stacking
- If the T comes early in second bag, you get a 100% PC rate!
- If not, you send 4 TSDs in a row. 
    - The flavor of the 2nd to 3rd TSD is up to you! 
        - If early L and J: Donation + remnant, or 
        - If early O: STSD
- Transitions into 5-4.
- Evaluating which mirror to start the build with can take some time.
