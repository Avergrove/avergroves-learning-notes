# MS2 (Mountainous Stacking 2)
- Tired of learning new openers? Learn this opener that's 3 openers in one!
- It's basically all the TDPC builds bundled together into one. (AKA, Gamushiro and friends, ironically Gamushiro is the most evil.)
- Unlike the other TDPC openers, this is not named after candy. Truly a tragedy.

- John Beak can do way better explanations than I do, I'm just writing this down here so I can memorize solutions!

## In VS
Follow hard drop, you thought SDPC spin was evil but..

You can learn Setup 2C (Stray cannon) + Setup 2E (Comproimise. Absent from John Beak).
Basically, this means if you can't build one, you can use the other.

Both can go for DPC, or go for 14L PC.

## Solves

### Stray Cannon solve
- It's relatively simple. Just slap the I on the side, then build two hearts. The O can act as a buffer between S and Z

### Gamushiro Default
- It's hell, where do i even begin. Honestly I would just learn the full recoveries. There's too many minimals.
- .. it may not even be a bad idea to go straight into mid-game.. but keep studying!
- Like Lime DPC, you might want to find a way to avoid it (for example, if no T piece is hogging your queue, you might just avoid it..)
- General tip:
    - It's possible to spin the I piece in the second row "without" a 3 height wall., you just have to spin counter clock-wise
        - Because this is a single-line clear in the middle. This will affect parity. Your T clears will be horizontal and there won't be anymore funny vertical SZ clears.
        - Even though I say this, the early TSD (actually Single) causes this too so.. yeah actually, forget that last tip.
        - Gamushiro default is parity neutral. So you need J+L or J/L + **Vertical T** to solve.

- If you don't want to stress about the minimals for now, you can start from learning the **full recoveries**:
    - Sol 1: Early T + J + SZ. Recover the O, solve the rest.
    - Sol 2: Early T + J + SO. Recover the Z. solve the rest.
    - Sol 3: Early T + J + ZL. Recover the S. Solve the rest

### Pancake Solve
- The solve is simpler than gamushiro, but you might be risking a gravity wait. It's less hellish but still  kind of painful.
    - Solve:
        - Group 1: Early TSD.
            - Sol 1: If you get center Z, then both J and L on left is fine.
            - Sol 2: If you get center S, then it must be L on right (make sure to connect the tips.)
        - Group 2: Early J
            - The O is always on top left.
            - Sol 1: Look for the symmetrical solve first: STZ in center.
            - Sol 2: Otherwise, SL on center.
            - Sol 3: Else, TZ towards right.
        - Group 3: wtf
            - Sol 1: I piece in center.
            - Sol 2: Early S + Z.
