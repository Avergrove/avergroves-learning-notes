# MS2 (Mountainous Stacking 2)
- Tired of learning new openers? Learn this opener that's 3 openers in one!
- It's basically all the TDPC builds bundled together into one. (AKA, Gamushiro and friends, ironically Gamushiro is the most evil.)
- Unlike the other TDPC openers, this is not named after candy. Truly a tragedy.

- John Beak can do way better explanations than I do, I'm just writing this down here so I can memorize solutions!

## In VS
If Hachispin was a "tamer" version of SDPC, then DOT cannon is the "tamer" version of MS2.

You can learn Setup 2C (Stray cannon) + Setup 2E (Compromise. Seems to be absent from John Beak at the moment).
Basically, this means if you can't build one, you can use the other.

2C can go for DPC, both can go for 14L PC.

## In Blitz (Looping)
You can reuse the solutions from VS if you want.

## Solves

### Stray Cannon 8L solve
- It's relatively simple. Just slap the I on the side, then build two hearts. The O can act as a buffer between S and Z
- But when it's not, you can always fall back to 14L solve.
- Otherwise.. 8L Solve:
    - The weird solutions generally involve putting O in the side groove.
    - Only one of S/Z is put near the TSD slot. This is the one that can fit horizontally. (but some solutiosn fit vertically.), so let's categorize them.
    - If you can spend the O first to create the heart in side. Do it.
    - An early TSD will likely allow you to save O.
    - Forgoing the TSD will allow you to save T.
    - Solution group 0: "Obvious hearts"
        - We are more interested in knowing when this doesn't work.
        - The first 4 pieces must be L+J. Then either S/Z/O
    - Solution group 1: Early LJ
        - This will involve a Middle line LJ Skim.
    - Solution group 2: Horizontal S:
        - These solutions are recommended if L/J are far apart.
    - Solution group 3: Vertical S
        - There's 2 formats: Vert T first or Vert S first
        - Vert S(ZT): For J+O
        - Vert T: This is actually an out of order of one of the S solutions.

### Compromise 14L solve

- Pay attention to this out of order solve, you need to do this quite often

- Group 1 (Base solution): J in center:
    - Sol 1+2: LS Heart above center (horizontal vs vertical). Toss the abandoned Z to the side. Fill the rest.
    - Sol 3: point the L in center towards a T piece! Solve the rest.
- Group 2: If you build a heart on the side, then you can use a center ISJ solution.
    - Or rather, if you see ISJ in center, build a heart on side!
- Group 3: Double SZ in the hole.
    - For early / late SZs
    - The JL sits side by side, too!


### Gamushiro Default
- It's hell, where do i even begin. Honestly I would just learn the full recoveries. There's too many minimals.
- .. it may not even be a bad idea to go straight into mid-game.. but keep studying!
- Like Lime DPC, you might want to find a way to avoid it (for example, if no T piece is hogging your queue, you might just avoid it..)
- General tip:
    - It's possible to spin the I piece in the second row "without" a 3 height wall., you just have to spin counter clock-wise
        - Because this is a single-line clear in the middle. This will affect parity. Your T clears will be horizontal and there won't be anymore funny vertical SZ clears.
        - Even though I say this, the early TSD (actually Single) causes this too so.. yeah actually, forget that last tip.
        - Gamushiro default is parity neutral. So you need J+L or J/L + **Vertical T** to solve.

- If you don't want to stress about the minimals for now, you can start from learning the **full recoveries**:
    - Sol 1: Early T + J + SZ. Recover the O, solve the rest.
    - Sol 2: Early T + J + SO. Recover the Z. solve the rest.
    - Sol 3: Early T + J + ZL. Recover the S. Solve the rest

### Pancake Solve
- The solve is simpler than gamushiro, but you might be risking a gravity wait. It's less hellish but still  kind of painful.
    - Solve:
        - Group 1: Early TSD.
            - Sol 1: If you get center Z, then both J and L on left is fine.
            - Sol 2: If you get center S, then it must be L on right (make sure to connect the tips.)
        - Group 2: Early J
            - The O is always on top left.
            - Sol 1: Look for the symmetrical solve first: STZ in center.
            - Sol 2: Otherwise, SL on center.
            - Sol 3: Else, TZ towards right.
        - Group 3: wtf
            - Sol 1: I piece in center.
            - Sol 2: Early S + Z.
