# Neutral Field Piece Consideration
You've downstack all the way to the bottom now, fantastic! But you're probably hit by decision paralysis right now...

You don't have a lot of time to think for this, so try and do it outside of VS!

Let's first analyze and observe what piece we have on-hand:

## JL Piece
- Is there a notch lying around?
    - You can start building a TST / Fractal
- Do you have an O piece with you?
    - You can build an STSD

## SZ Piece
- Is there a 2-wide hole somewhere?
    - Can you build an STSD out of it?
- Is there a 3-wide hole?
    - You can STMB Cave it!
- Is there neither?
    - Honestly, just stack clean. Look at your queue where your SZ will fit snugly.

## T piece
- Is there anywhere that needs a parity fix?
- Why not build a fractal? 
- You can save it too! 
- An STSD is easier to build when your parity offset is 0. 

## I piece
- Just hold the I piece. You will need it because garbage will come quickly.

## O piece
- uhhhhHHHHHHhh, maybe build an STSD? You could also build a hamburger, mmm hamburger.
