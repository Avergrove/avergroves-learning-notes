# 8-1 Stacking
- The black sheep of the family. Stacking 8-1 is pain because you need double I-pieces to even do anything, and even more so when garbage is currently spawning in 8-1 (See: Zenith tower)
- But really this page is more of what options are available to you because you got clean garbage on column 8.

- You will probably need to toss an I piece into the 1 column to start doing any of these techniques so you can fill up from the bottom.
- The main feature of 8-1 is starting with an I to build up the 1-side and using the J/L piece to utilize it.

## Shachiku Chain
- Unlike in 9-0, Shachiku Train (Chain) becomes a strong option since you can chain it endlessly provided you stack well enough, similar to ST / LST Stacking.
- Shachiku chain doesn't cause a height difference, but it does cause the floor level to increase by one each iteration.

## Parapet Chaining
- Another option in keeping B2B is chaining parapets on top of each other.
    - This is your only other option in helping your 1 side increase in height outside of using I pieces.

    ### Inverted Parapet
        - For when your stack is lower than your 1 column...

## STSD
- Like Shachiku and Parapet except you use an inverted L piece on the 1 side.
    - King Crimson: An TST stacked on top of a TST, it requires an S piece, *then* only an inverted L piece on top. It's somewhat dangerous to use this, but a TDD attack is truly incredible..
- STSD has a habit of continuing to leave 2 wide wells, so be careful when using it.

## 9-0 techniques
- Remember all 9-0 techniques are still available to you! So you can always continue to do the ol' reliable of natural donations after building up the 1-side.

## Hyper Fractal
- If you don't care about back to back, hyper fractal is a strong defensive option. Hyper fractals will keep the tetris hole open at any given time, while you build up TSD slots for spiking.

## 8-1 Stacking sprint achievement
Interestingly, you can stack in a very 5-4 pattern-ny way, using LOJ boxes and SZTs together! The video here should showcase this well enough:
