# 8-1 Stacking
- The black sheep of the family. Stacking 8-1 is pain because you need double I-pieces to even do anything, and even more so when garbage is currently spawning in 8-1 (See: Zenith tower)
- But really this page is more of what options are available to you because you got clean garbage on column 8.

## Parapet Chaining
- Your main option in keeping B2B is chaining parapets on top of each other.
    - This is your only other option in helping your 1 side increase in height outside of using I pieces.

## King Crimson
- Otherwise, you can try and pull off King Crimson. The requirement is a single block in the 1 side and 1 height above the ground. if it's not 1 height above the ground, then well, nothing's stopping your from pouring concrete to fill it up..

## Hyper Fractal
- If you don't care about back to back, hyper fractal is a strong defensive option. Hyper fractals will keep the tetris hole open at any given time, while you build up TSD slots for spiking.
