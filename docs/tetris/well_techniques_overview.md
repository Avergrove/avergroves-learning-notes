# Well Techniques Overview
This page discusses what techniques become available to you for stacking in each column. i.e. 5-4, 6-3, 7-2, 8-1, 9-0.
But really it's just here to talk about 8-1 and 9-0.
- Most techniques from 9-0 are availble in other wells before it, while techniques from 5-4 are not available in 9-0 (ie because they require space on the other side of the well.)

## 5-4 Stacking
- This is as freestyle as stacking gets, all techniques are available to you.
- The problem is that this is really entirely freestyle. Too much might be available to you. 
- If you want a more "structured" stacking option, try using Prop stacking + creating holes with 1-2-4 tall gaps. 3 gaps are a big no-no for some reason.
    - Galactoid has a few pages on props for T-spinning:

## 6-3 Stacking
- This is the primary stacking method used in Sprints. The main reason for this is lowest Key per Piece, and also the 3 side has very... patterned stacking methods.
- It's less freestyle, but it's definitely easier to build.
- It's also recommended for you to read up on T-parity. The problem can most obviously be seen when you put a T on the 3-side. Stacking becomes hell there..
    - But of course, imbalanced T-parity also means more Tspeen opportunity so.. If you aren't sprinting, feel free to crap on the 3-side if you feel like it.

## 7-2 Stacking
- 7-2 is the traditional type used when LST stacking and ST stacking.
- LST and ST stacking is basically where all the TSD ares and where you practice resource management and queue reading the most.

## 8-1 Stacking
- The black sheep of the family. Stacking 8-1 is pain because you need double I-pieces to even do anything, and even more so when garbage is currently spawning in 8-1 (See: Zenith tower)
- Options:
    - Keep B2B:
        - Parapet chaining
        - King Crimson
            - It's a risky build due to its height, however, if you already have a height and just need to slap on that JZ.. it's a fantastic choice. 
                - The criteria to build is somewhat specific, though. It has to be a single block in the corner, or the STSD gets ruined!
    - Don't care about B2B: Hyper Fractal. An extremely strong option because your tetris well is always open!
- Your main option is to chain together using Parapet TSSs if you want to maintain that b2b and grow that side height without an I-piece!
- If you don't care about B2B, you can actually look into Hyper fractals! It's actually an extremely useful option here because your tetris well will always be available

## 9-0 Stacking
- The beginner recommendation. I want to write more options you have available here because these also work in other stacking types!
- Options:
    - B2B Maintaining:
        - Natural donation:
            - Basically covering the well with any piece, really. To keep it simple, look for just TSD ones and avoid building TSTs.
        - Kaidan
            - You will see this EXTREMELY often. It's also easy to identify! Kaidan means stairs, so just look for stairs and slap an S
        - Hamburger stacking (3 wide)
        - Shachiku Train stacking (4 wide, 2 tall side area):
            - Basically Hamburger Stacking but for a 4 wide area side.
        - Yoshihiro SD (4 wide, 3 tall side area)
            - It's two t-spin doubles and an L piece that needs to come in the correct order. So be careful when going for this one.
        - Reverse Yoshihiro (3 wide, 1 tall side area):
            - Tspin single into a tspin double!
    - B2B breaking (Skimming):
        - Although skimming is not recommended, I would recommend trying to learn them anyway because they are still useful in in other stacks anyway, and you might read up on them and see their additional uses!
            - Also, doing it helps with t-spin recognition.
        - Skimming TSD Setups:
            - Grim Grotto: A skimming technique that let's you create 1-wide holes out of 2-wide ones. If kaidan is not available, this is an option to create a TSD slot.
            - QTK: It's like hamburger stacking flipped on it's side..
        - Dejavu: Basically you create TSD slot by forming a donut shape using a LJ pair shape.
            - This is only available when you are the very bottom however.
