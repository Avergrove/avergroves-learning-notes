# Strategy Counter
This page talks about the theoretical counter to each playstyle

## Plonk
- Your opponent will use your garbage against you. 
- The good news is that these opponents are at a defensive disadvantage. As long as you pressure them by sending consistent pressure, they will give in eventually.
- Try and use only one quad / TSD attack at a time instead of bursting. It's likely they're playing safe.
    - Save the other attack for defense, now you have the plonk advantage!
- You can also send some cheese to them to prevent them from sending clean efficiently.

### Sub-topic: Non Openers
- Your opponent will not attempt to build up at all the start of the game.
    - You can send cheese garbage, which can nullify their plonk advantage.
    - Attacker Tip: You can pay attention to where the first garbage is sent to them and build first accordingly! 
        - The garbage generation order on both sides is identical.
        - So if the first pile of garbage that spawns on the enemy side is on column 2, then you can start funnelling around column 2!
        - The garbage will still be in the first location even if you cancel it partially or fully. If partially, then the same amount of garbage spawn, if fully, then the next set will spawn there.


## Blitzer (Pressurer)
- Your opponent will attempt to to use consistent damage against you. You should break their momentum by sending dirty garbage so they can't keep up their back to back

### Mech TSD
- Your opponent will attempt to repeat TSDs.
- The main downfall of this is that they can't downstack properly. The longer this goes on, the harder it is for them to go down!
- So ideally you should be accepting garbage, then sending back to them.

## 2 Wide
- Your opponent will attempt to build a 2-wide and finish it off with a quad.
- It SURE would be a shame if the end of their combo had cheese in the wrong position...
    - If they fail to combo the cheese, they are now forced to downstack and play the game.
    - Therefore, start the game by sending just a bit of cheese, then start building regularly and pressuring!
    - As always, remember that luck probably is on your side. There's a 2 out of 10 chance it's a clean send into the well. 8 out of 10 chance it's a blocked send.
    - However.. please make sure you keep a difficult line clear ready to prevent the cheese.

## (Center) 4 wide
- Your opponent will build a center 4 wide, a hybrid between sending cheese and potentially a burst on your attacks. In order to burst down a 4 wider, you will need to send 20 attacks at once, which isn't very doable at mid rank.
- C4W can be considered a hybrid playstyle. It doesn't excel in anything in particular, but it does everything. Cheese, combo, burst, defense, you name it!
- Ideally, you should try and send a bit of cheese, then start pressuring, your opponent won't be able to build height and potentially send a burst.
- Each 4x line sent means less damage returned afterwards (they won't be able to combo as much), in other words, 4wide will effectively be a stat check to see how well you can pressure the opponent.
- Directly pressuring is not always a good idea. If a 4-wider sees you blasting everything at once, they will just accept everything and reset for a massive burst.

## Inf DS / Cheeser
- Your opponent will send cheese. Over and over again. At the bottom of the board.
- Your best bet is to cancel cheese using high efficiency attacks. Don't get cheesed! Even the best downstackers know cheese takes a lot of time to clear.
- Sending clean to them will force them to send clean back to you, so don't forget to save the I-piece to no-u them.
