# Strategy Counter
This page talks about the theoretical counter to each playstyle

## Plonk
- Your opponent will refuse to build up. 
- They will use your garbage against you. 
- The good news is that these opponents are at a defensive disadvantage. As long as you pressure them by sending consistent pressure, they will give in eventually.
- Try and use only one quad / TSD attack at a time instead of bursting. It's likely they're playing safe.
    - Save the other attack for defense, now you have the plonk advantage!

### Sub-topic: Non Openers
- Your opponent will not attempt to build up at all the start of the game.
    - You can send cheese garbage, which can nullify their plonk advantage.


## Blitzer (Pressurer)
- Your opponent will attempt to to use consistent damage against you. You should break their momentum by sending dirty garbage so they can't keep up their back to back

## 2 Wide
- Your opponent will attempt to build a 2-wide and finish it off with a quad.
- It SURE would be a shame if the end of their combo had cheese in the wrong position...
    - If they fail to combo the cheese, they are now forced to downstack and play the game.
    - Therefore, start the game by sending just a bit of cheese, then start building regularly and pressuring!

## (Center) 4 wide
- Your opponent will build a center 4 wide, a hybrid between sending cheese and potentially a burst on your attacks. In order to burst down a 4 wider, you will need to send 20 attacks at once, which isn't very doable at mid rank.
- C4W can be considered a hybrid playstyle. It doesn't excel in anything in particular, but it does everything. Cheese, combo, burst, defense, you name it!
- Ideally, you should try and send a bit of cheese, then start pressuring, your opponent won't be able to build height and potentially send a burst.
- Each 4x line sent means less damage returned afterwards (they won't be able to combo as much), in other words, 4wide will effectively be a stat check to see how well you can pressure the opponent.

- Directly pressuring is also an option. Remember that you have the probability advantage when sending garbage.
    - There's a 3 out of 10 chance they get a nice clean hole
    - There's a 4 out of 10 chance they get a blocked hole


## Inf DS
- Your opponent will attempt to use cheese garbage on you
- Try and have defense ready so the garbage doesn't overwhelm you. Try and count to four and prophecy TSD as you downstack. This will force them to send clean garbage back to you for use!
    - Of course, try and avoid sending while the opponent isn't in any sort of danger..
