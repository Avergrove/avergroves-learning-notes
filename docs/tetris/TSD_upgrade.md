- I'm splitting TSD "Upgrades" into several types. The main objective is to create a second T-spin somehow that doesn't impede the first. The main idea of learning this is to keep building when your T piece hasn't come yet.

- T-spins are usually limited to 2 or 3 at a time.
    - 2 is quite likely since you might be holding a T piece.
    - 3 is because you want to get started on the incoming T piece.
    - 4 starts turning the needed T into a dependency.

## Upgrade 1: TSD Stacking
- You can always stack more TSDs on top of a TSD. The available options are..
    - Fractal: A TSD on top of a TSD. Usually only 2 is present at a time thanks to LST stacking. 
    - Cut Copy: A more horizontal version of a fractal that cuts the original in half with a TSD donation before setting up the overhang.
        - Uncut Copy: It's basically fractals shifted left or right.

### Upgrade 2a: DT Cannon Conversion
All TSDs can be converted into a DT cannon as long as there is at least a 2-7 style platform.
- So DT cannon upgrades becomes the bread and button for double T-spin attacks.

### Upgrade 2b: Parapet into BT Cannon / C-Spin
- Parapets TSD slots have the diagonal hole needed to form BT Cannon / C-spin
- 

### Upgrade 3: 3-wide hole Conversion
#### 3a: STSD
- The more straightrforward choice. STSDs clean itself up afterwards

#### 3b: Magic Key
- The other option is using magic key. (Hint: It also uses heart shape). Magic key can be considered if O was used as your overhang.

Most TSDs can be upgrade into DT Cannons
- If you don't expect to do the second fractal on an LST successfully, you can always convert it into DT Cannon

## Upgrade 4: Salvaging "Unusable" Heart
If one side is stacked with hearts, while it's unable to build a full TSD slots on the other, you can instead opt to convert your hearts into B2b TST towers.
- You will need at least one I piece for this.

## Other Notes:

## Upgrade 2:
Parity fix into DT STSD
- If the wall distance is 4, you can use this as an option by using SZ to create a vertical SZ s haped hole, now it's actually an advange!


## TSD -> DT Cannon

## S/Z Hole -> DT STSD

## "Failed" LST -> DT + TSD
    - In other words, it's a DT built on top of a TSD. You are basic

- Make sure to practice each of them to start jogging up your T-spin upgrade vision!


- 2 DT Cannons "Stacked" together will form an quadraple TSD.
    - Galactoid calls this Altair.
    - building like this is necessary because we don't have the extra 2 lines under the well.

- Parity Fix: You will need to use Fin -> ISO TSD. Wow that is a complicated pattern.
    - Maybe you can put an S/Z instead to convert into DT STSD.. See four.LOL

- "Failed" LST (With S or Z on one side) can be converted into DT STSD.
