- I'm splitting TSD "Upgrades" into several types. The main objective is to create a second T-spin somehow that doesn't impede the first. The main idea of learning this is to keep building when your T piece hasn't come yet.

- T-spins are usually limited to 2 or 3 at a time.
    - 2 is quite likely since you might be holding a T piece.
    - 3 is because you want to get started on the incoming T piece.
    - 4 starts turning the needed T into a dependency.

## Upgrade 1a: TSD Stacking
- You can always stack more TSDs on top of another TSD. There's really only 3 types.
    - Fractal: A TSD on top of a TSD. Usually only 2 is present at a time thanks to LST stacking. 
    - Cut Copy: A more horizontal version of a fractal that cuts the original in half with a TSD donation before setting up the overhang.
        - Uncut Copy: It's basically fractals shifted left or right.

### Upgrade 1b: TST-styled Spin upgrades
- This category involves upgrading your TSDs into TST style spins.
    - TST: Place an I piece on the left or right side.
        - TD: When the TSD forms a 2-step stair around a diagonal hole.
    - STSD: Place an L or J piece on either left or right of the TSD hole.
    - DT Cannon: Place and LZ / JS on left / right. There must be a pit below.

### Upgrade 2: Unique upgrades
- Parapet TSD slots have the diagonal hole needed to form BT Cannon / C-spin
