# TSD Upgrades
This page assumes your TSDs are built on top of a T-spin well. These are also the most fundamental form of x2 T-spin layouts. Remember you can always cut each layout in half and slot more in between, but this page only describes upgrading one TSD into another in a single set of steps.

## TSD Stacking
The first category is stacking TSDs on top of TSDs.

### Fractals
Fractals are THE most premiere and natural TSD upgrade, it's effectively stacking up a TSD on a TSD!
- They're fantastic because they don't block the Tetris well, you will always be "safe" as long as you hold onto a T or I piece!
    - They're also the only option that doesn't block the tetris well at all..
- They also tend to have symmetric piece requirements due to how fractals are symmetric.

### Cut Copy / Uncut copy
Cut copy is a TSD cut in half with another TSD slotted in between. 
- Unlike fractals, this WILL block the tetris well, be careful!
- Cut copy is a bit unintuitive to build normally, instead of thinking of upgrading a TSD slot into a cut copy, try and identify what's *below* a TSD slot already! ie, the second TSD should be prophesized.

Uncut copy is effectively fractals shifted sideways.
- You can think of it as a donation TSD on top of a TSD slot. 

## TST-styled Spin upgrades
- TST Styled spin upgrades tend to be dangerous to go for due to blocking the tetris well. BUT, if your opponent is pressured, it's not a bad idea at all! 

### T-Spin Triple
- If you block one side of the TSD slot, you get a TST slot, this however, is a large commitment because you are now sacrificing your slot for "just" a triple, AND blocking your well!
- It's really not recommended to upgrade a TSD into one unless you have an emergency defense plan available.

### DT Cannon
- A healthier alternative is DT cannon! You have the option of abandoning it halfway if needed while upgrading!
- The DT cannon shape requires a +1 deep well to perform, so if your TSD base is on the ground zero, it won't work.
- Typically uses LZ / JS to upgrade.

### Imperial Cross
- A relatively intuitive build, make a cross, then build an overhang! 
- The main problem is that Imperial Cross has a habit of shifting away from the well... so in the ideal scenario, you want to have a somewhat cut copy and upgrade it!
- Typically uses SZ to upgrade.

### Trinity
- An STSD stacked on top of a TSD. Like DT Cannon, this doesn't block the tetris well and can be abandoned mid-build, so it's a great idea to remember this!
- Like STSD, remember that the bend and the well must be on the same side. The overhang must be opposite of the well.
- Yields 3 TSDs! 
- The main issue is that it's extremely unlikely that you have 3 TSDs back to back. You need to perform two TSDs before you can access your quad well again!
