# TSD Upgrades
This page assumes your TSDs are built on top of a T-spin well. These are also the most fundamental form of x2 T-spin layouts. Remember you can always cut each layout in half and slot more in between, but this page only describes upgrading one TSD into another in a single set of steps.

## TSD Stacking
The first category is stacking TSDs on top of TSDs.

### Fractals (Spider, Double Dagger)
Fractals are THE most premiere and natural TSD upgrade, it's effectively stacking up a TSD on a TSD!
- They're fantastic because they don't block the Tetris well, you will always be "safe" as long as you hold onto a T or I piece!
    - They're also the only option that doesn't block the tetris well at all
- Fractal 1: True fractals, they are two TSDs layered on top of each other with overhang on both sides
- Fractal 2: Half-sided fractal, the fractal on top is floated higher. 
- Fractals can also be difficult to build without using T shapes nor skimming.
- Skimming: The two technniques used for creating fractals is Zipper (LSZT) and Hyper Fractal (LJ) 
    - Zipper: You cover off both side overhangs of a TSD using Grim Grotto (SZ Skim)
    - Hyper Fractal: You cover off both side overhangs of a TSD using Shallow Grave (Cremate, LJ Skim)
    - Both these techniques are used to equalize height differences.

### Cut Copy / Uncut copy
Cut copy is a TSD cut in half with another TSD slotted in between. 
- Unlike fractals, this WILL block the tetris well, be careful!
- Cut copy is a bit unintuitive to build normally, instead of thinking of upgrading a TSD slot into a cut copy, try and identify what's *below* a TSD slot already! ie, the second TSD should be prophesized.

Uncut copy is effectively fractals shifted sideways.
- You can think of it as a donation TSD on top of a TSD slot. 

## TST-styled Spin upgrades
- TST Styled spin upgrades tend to be dangerous to go for due to blocking the tetris well. BUT, if your opponent is pressured, it's not a bad idea at all! 
- TST Upgrade tip: 
    - Try and think of TSD overhangs in advance:
        - JL: Look for notches. This should have the same appearance as a TST.
        - SZ at ground level, place them flat down. You need at least a 3x wide area on one side to do this cleanly.
    - Try and use S/Z (flat down) or I (flat down) or J/L (upright, so 3 height needed) to form the TSD overhang first! This helps keep building the rest simple!
        - The main reason for this is that the overhang tends to form the notch of the spin. We want to keep the area above the notch as clean as possible!
        - DT Cannon: Although you can use an LJ for the TSD overhang here, the LJ are more easily used to build the notch and overhang of the DT cannon so you don't cause resource starvation.
        - Using an L/J for the TST notch has a habit of requiring something behind the L/J notch to reinforce the wall and help kick the T-piece in.
    - Using I or T may not be recommended because our I is needed for defense, and T is needed to consume the TST spin itself, but if you have a surplus of them, might as well use it!

### T-Spin Triple
- If you block one side of the TSD slot, you get a TST slot, this however, is a large commitment because you are now sacrificing your slot for "just" a triple, AND blocking your well!
- It's really not recommended to upgrade a TSD into one unless you have an emergency defense plan available.

### DT Cannon
- A more fruitful alternative is DT cannon.
- The DT cannon shape requires a +1 deep well to perform, so if your TSD base is on the ground zero, it won't work.
- Construction of the DT cannon is unique in that the overhang used in TSD turns into the overhang of the overall DT Cannon.
- Typically uses LZ / JS to upgrade.

### Imperial Cross
- A relatively intuitive build, make a cross, then build an overhang! 
- The main problem is that Imperial Cross has a habit of shifting away from the well... so in the ideal scenario, you want to have a somewhat cut copy and upgrade it!
- Typically uses SZ to upgrade.

### STSD
- It's a square hole.. with a notch!
- Unlike Imperial Cross, the hole does NOT shift. The notch will still block the well from Quad-ding temporarily, though.
- However, the notch and the well must be on the same side, otherwise STSD won't work. Boomerang can be used to salvage this.
- STSDs can be built looking for square shapes. Ideally built starting at 0, -1, and -2 height.
- If the two ledges are too high up, you can try using Grim Grotto / Ice Axe to build one.
- Uniquely, STSDs aren't TSD upgrades at all.. In fact, it's just included here for reference.

### Trinity
- An STSD stacked on top of a TSD. Like DT Cannon, this doesn't block the tetris well and can be abandoned mid-build, so it's a great idea to remember this!
- Like STSD, remember that the bend and the well must be on the same side. The overhang must be opposite of the well.
- Yields 3 TSDs! 
- The main issue is that it's extremely unlikely that you have 3 TSDs back to back. You need to perform two TSDs before you can access your quad well again!
- Because Trinity is 3 TSDs in one, it wll help while your parity is lopsided and offset by one.

### Upgrade Chaining
- STSD and C-Spin leaves behind a natural TSD slot after the first T-spin. This is the ideal slot used for upgrades! It already has an overhang on one side so you can just pick and select on the other!
