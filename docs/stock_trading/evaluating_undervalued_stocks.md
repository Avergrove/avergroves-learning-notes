# Evaluating Undervalued stocks
- When is a stock undervalued?

1. PE (Price-to-earning) Ratio (Forward PE should be lower than usual)
    - A stock's PE ratio is usually consistent. (If not, go find one! More data the better!)
    - If a stock's PE ratio is lower than usual, that means it's undervalued, and you can buy while it corrects itself.
    - This is usually compared with forward PE: a 12 month forecast forward versus the usual backwards.
    - So a lower forward PE compared to (just normal PE) is better

2. PB (Price-to-Book) ratio (Lower is good)
    - PB Ratio = (Price per share / Book per share)
    - A P/B = 1 indicates equal valued
    - A P/B < 1 indicates undervalued.
    - A P/B > 1 indicates overvalued, you will be paying more than that is valued.
    - PB Ratio = (Stock Price) / (Book Value per share)

3. PS (Price-to-sales) Ratio
    - PS = (Price per share / Revenue per share)
    - Youll notice this repeating trend of pershare / pershare a lot. This is used to normalize large numbers with small ones.
    - Anyway, revenue per share is exactly that, if a company makes a lot of money, but only has a small number of shares, that means One share is giving plenty of revenue!
    - PS Ratio is often compared to an the industry the company belongs to.

4. Dividend Yield % (High is good)
    - Surprise! It's a per share formula again.
    - Divident yield = ((Annual dividend per share) / (Stock price per share)) x 100%
    - Similar to PS Ratio, dividend yield is compared to the industry.
    - A stock with a dividend yield of 5% in an indsutry of 2% is considered undervalued.

5. Discounted Cash Flow analysis
    - The heck is discounted cash flow.

6. Earnings Growth Potential
    - When we think of investors in a shareholder meeting, this is probably the first we think about.
    - Earnings Growth Potential = PEG ratio = (P/E ratio) / (Earnings growth rate)
    - A PEG Ratio < 1 may indicate undervalue.
