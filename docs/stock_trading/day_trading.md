# Day Trading
Trading that involves buying something at the start of the day, and hopefully clearing it out by the end of the day.
(Or week? There's likely some sort of effect that changes the price of weekends..)

- A good financial instrument should have the following characteritic:
    - Highly Volatile (We want to sell using the swing)
    - Highly Liquid (We want to be able to sell anytime we want)
    - High Trading Volume (Helps keep trends stable)

I have even *less* know ledge on this, this one really is just straight up writing to remember, don't trust anything at all here!

One of the suggested financial instrument for Day trading are commodities, so let's do research!
