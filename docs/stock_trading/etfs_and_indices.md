# ETFs and Indices
- An index is a market benchmark. It usually consists of the biggest stocks in a stock market.
- ETFs are like stocks that consist of many little stocks. As these little stocks rise and fall, so does the ETF.
    - Usually each ETF consists of stuff from the same industry. So they generally follow a trend together.
    - The juicy part is that you can observe how each of these little stocks compare to the ETF itself. Is the trend rising and falling together? 
    - An underperforming stock can quickly rebalance itself to ETF benchmark levels. So you can invest in these.
    - Eh? Which stock to buy? I'm not your financial advisor, go do your research!
