# Fundamentals

- Fundamentals as in, basic knowledge, not the analytical fundamentals.

- The stock market: The most fundamental way a stock trader earns money is to invest in undervalued stock, (hopefully) helping them develop, and cash out.
- Risk: When an investor invests in a company, this intrisically introduces risk. With that, we want to start with an asset that has 0 risk... (is that possible?!)
    - You first answer might be banks but.. there's an even safer choice
    - Turns out, we can invest in the government. This has "zero" risk because they can always keep printing money.
    - A way to invest in the government is to invest in futures.
    - A future is an "I owe you", they're almost the same as fixed deposits except... they're tradable!
    - You can now sell these futures to other people. 
- Growth rate: (Earnings this period - Earnings last period) / (Earnings last period)
    - Annualized Growth rate =  ((Final year / initial year) ^ (1/n) - 1)
    - You should use both when evaluating growth rate..
