# Yoyo
Yoyos are pretty cool.

Anyway my initial impression about yoyos is that they have a simple design, two pieces of block on the side, with a little stick thing (actually called fixed axle) in the middle.

And then I started shopping for yoyos.

How the hell do you even pick a yoyo.

There's responsive yoyos, unresponsive yoyos, styles of play, string tricks, what?

Anyway, after watching a few videos and a bit of research, I found the following.

The most traditional yoyo tricks are built on the Sleeper. The name sounds cool, but it really is just is tossing the yoyo such that it won't spin up unless you want it to.

Surprisingly enough, apparently even your initial impression basic just blocks and fixed axle yoyo can "sleep". I haven't tried this yet.

But yes if you are looking for a "regular" yoyo these days, look for something that can start from a sleeper.
